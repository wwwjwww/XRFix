    "code_repairing_2": "In the code you provided, it is clear that this script is intended to run on a Unity game object.

    "code_repairing_3": "Your provided code seems to be incomplete or incorrect. I'll guide you on how to complete it.\n\nFirstly, we need to ensure that the `Update()` method is commented so as to not interfere with the original implementation.\n\nThen, to properly manage and control the game timing, you need to calculate the time when the player hits the finish line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() \n{\n   if (!isGameOver) \n   {\n      gameTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n      uiText.text = \"Time: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(gameTimer) + \"   Score: \" + player.score  +  \"   Speed: \" + Mathf.Floor(player.speed);\n   } \n   else \n   {\n      gameOverTimer -= Time.deltaTime;\n      if (gameOverTimer > 0) \n      {\n         uiText.text = \"Game Over!\\nTime: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(finalTime) + \"   Score: \" + finalScore + \"\\nRestarting in: \" + Mathf.Floor(gameOverTimer);\n      }\n      else \n      {\n         SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\nIn this updated code, `isGameOver` should be a property of `GameManager` with a `set` method that sets the game-over state and the final score and time when the player finishes. The `Update()` method will check if the game is over, and if so, it will display the game over UI and restart the game if the timer has reached 0.\n\nFor ensuring the enemies are being spawned properly, you may want to use a Coroutine for this:\n\n```csharp\nIEnumerator SpawnEnemies()\n{\n    while (true)\n    {\n        GameObject enemyObject = Instantiate(enemyPrefab);\n        enemyObject.transform.position = new Vector3(Random.Range(-4f, 4f), Random.Range(2.5f, 6.5f), player.cameraRig.transform.position.z + spawnDistanceFromPlayer);\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f); // or any other interval you prefer\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can start this Coroutine in your `Start()` method with `StartCoroutine(SpawnEnemies());`. This ensures an infinite loop of spawning enemies every 0.1 seconds (for example). \n\nNote that the `Update()` method should contain only the timing and UI manipulation logic. The spawning of enemies, player behaviour, finishing, and other game mechanics should be managed by separate methods or Coroutines.",
