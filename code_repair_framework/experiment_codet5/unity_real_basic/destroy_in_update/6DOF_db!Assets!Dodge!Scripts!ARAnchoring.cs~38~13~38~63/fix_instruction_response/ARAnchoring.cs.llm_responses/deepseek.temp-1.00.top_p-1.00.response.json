    "code_repairing_0": "From your question, it seems like you are trying to optimize the Update() method in your ARAnchoring script. You want to eliminate usage of Destroy() inside the Update() method, which is inefficient because Destroy() causes a frame of delay. A solution to this problem is to use an object pool to manage the lifecycle of DetectedPlanePrefab instances. \n\nHowever, without the full context of your application (like what you're trying to achieve by using ARAnchoring and the actual issue you're facing), it's hard to provide a specific solution. But here's a general idea of how you can start optimizing your Update() method:\n\n1. **Instantiate the plane object only once**: Instead of instantiating a new plane object in the Update() method every frame, you could instantiate it once when your application starts and keep reusing this object. This reduces the number of calls to Instantiate().\n\n2. **Pull out expensive calculations into Start() or Awake()**: As you are setting the `Screen.sleepTimeout` in the Start() method, you might want to move this line to Awake() or the Start method of the GameObject (which is attached to the ARAnchoring script).\n\n3. **Use the FixedUpdate() method instead of Update()**: FixedUpdate() has a fixed time between frames and is better for physics-related updates. If your application doesn't use any physics, you could consider using FixedUpdate().\n\n4. **Object Pooling**: As you mentioned, you can use an object pool to manage the lifecycle of DetectedPlanePrefab instances. You create a pool of these objects that are reused every time a new plane is detected.\n\nRemember, these are general tips and might not be applicable for your specific situation. Always analyze your application and decide which optimizations are necessary based on your specific needs.",
    "code_repairing_1": "One way to fix this issue is by creating an object pool before the `Update()` method is called. This can be done to optimize the memory usage by reusing the same game objects instead of destroying and creating them in each frame.\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can implement object pooling in C#:\n\n```csharp\npublic class GameObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int initialSize;\n\n    private List<GameObject> m_Pool;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        m_Pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab, transform);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            m_Pool.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject Get()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < m_Pool.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!m_Pool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                m_Pool[i].SetActive(true);\n                return m_Pool[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab, transform);\n        m_Pool.Add(obj);\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn your `ARAnchoring` script, you can use the object pool like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic GameObjectPool planeObjectPool;\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    // ...\n    // Other code\n    // ...\n\n    if (Frame.Raycast(Screen.width * 0.5f, Screen.height * 0.5f, raycastFilter, out hit))\n    {\n        // ...\n        // Other code\n        // ...\n\n        if ((hit.Trackable is DetectedPlane) && (Vector3.Dot(FirstPersonCamera.transform.position - hit.Pose.position, hit.Pose.rotation * Vector3.up) < 0))\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Hit at back of the current DetectedPlane\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            GameObject andyObject = planeObjectPool.Get();\n            andyObject.transform.position = hit.Pose.position;\n            andyObject.transform.rotation = hit.Pose.rotation;\n            var anchor = hit.Trackable.CreateAnchor(hit.Pose);\n            andyObject.transform.parent = anchor.transform;\n            FirstPersonCamera.GetComponent<ARCoreBackgroundRenderer>().enabled = false;\n            isVR = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `GameObjectPool` script is attatched to a GameObject in your scene, and the `Object Pool` field in the `ARAnchoring` script is assigned to that GameObject. The `prefab` field is set to the `DetectedPlanePrefab` and the `initialSize` is set to the number of initial instances of `DetectedPlanePrefab` you want to create.",
    "code_repairing_2": "When the Destroy() function is called inside of an Update() function, it can cause frame rate issues and inefficient use of memory. The problem is that once an object is destroyed, it will not be instantiated again at the same location. \n\nInstead of using Destroy(), you can save the created objects in a pool and remove the objects when they have been used. This will allow you to better use memory and avoid performance issues caused by constantly creating and destroying objects. \n\nHere is some pseudo code to illustrate this.\n\n```\nprivate List<GameObject> planeObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if (isVR)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Session.GetTrackables<DetectedPlane>(m_AllPlanes);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n    {\n        // if there is already a plane object in the pool, use it instead of creating a new one\n        GameObject planeObject;\n        if (i < planeObjects.Count)\n        {\n            planeObject = planeObjects[i];\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            planeObject = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform);\n            planeObjects.Add(planeObject);\n        }\n\n        planeObject.GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n    }\n\n    //... rest of the code\n\n}\n```\n\nWith this code, every frame, the script checks whether a plane object exists for every DetectedPlane. If one exists, it is used; if not, a new one is instantiated. This approach reduces the frequency of object creation and destruction and improves performance.\n\nPlease note that you need to manage the lifetime of your objects in the pool, as they may contain resources that will not be freed up if they are destroyed. This could be managed with a simple loop in `Destroy` function, that sets GameObject `SetActive(false)` instead of destroying it:\n\n```\nforeach (var obj in planeObjects)\n{\n    obj.SetActive(false);\n}\n```\nRepeat this in the Update function to return all objects to pool at the start of frame. Then within the detecting loop you can simply set objects to `gameObject.SetActive(true)` and all necessary data.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code is causing the Update() function to be invoked in every single frame. This could potentially lead to performance issues if not appropriately managed. You can use object pooling to avoid the overhead that comes with constantly instantiating and destroying new objects in Update. Here's a general approach to do so:\n\n1. Create a method to handle instantiation of your plane objects. This method can take a DetectedPlane as a parameter and return a GameObject that has been instantiated:\n```csharp\nprivate GameObject InstantiatePlaneObject(DetectedPlane detectedPlane)\n{\n    GameObject planeObject = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform);\n    planeObject.GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(detectedPlane);\n    return planeObject;\n}\n```\n2. Instead of calling Instantiate() every frame inside the Update() method, create a list to hold the GameObjects and call InstantiatePlaneObject() when needed:\n```csharp\nprivate List<GameObject> m_PlaneObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if (isVR)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Session.GetTrackables<DetectedPlane>(m_AllPlanes);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n    {\n        // Add instantiated GameObjects to the list\n        m_PlaneObjects.Add(InstantiatePlaneObject(m_AllPlanes[i]));\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the code...\n}\n```\n3. You will need to clear your list of GameObjects each frame. This can be done in a separate method that is called at the start of Update():\n```csharp\nprivate void ClearPlaneObjects()\n{\n    foreach (GameObject planeObject in m_PlaneObjects)\n    {\n        Destroy(planeObject);\n    }\n    m_PlaneObjects.Clear();\n}\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    ClearPlaneObjects();\n    // Rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that object pooling could be more efficient if the amount of DetectedPlanes to instantiate is significantly large.\n\nBesides, your bug is about calling Destroy() in Update(), it's not related to inefficiency. If you want to ensure that your plane objects are always destroyed when the scene is exited, you should consider moving this responsibility to the MonoBehaviour's OnDestroy() function.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The original Update() method is not efficient because it's continuously allocating objects on each frame, which can lead to a memory leak situation. When the DetectedPlane is no longer in the tracking state or AR anchoring is in VR mode, the currently instantiated objects are not needed anymore and can be destroyed to save memory.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a pooling system to reuse the plane objects. Object pooling is a design pattern that uses a set of objects that are reused in a cyclic manner. They have a fixed number of elements (usually prefabs) which are created at the beginning of the game. Then, instead of destroying and recreating elements each time, you just hide them and bring them back when needed.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n1. First, you can create a GameObject Pool to hold your DetectedPlaneVisualizer objects. You can do this in an Editor script, since it doesn't change during gameplay.\n\n```csharp\npublic class GameObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int initialPoolSize = 10;\n    private List<GameObject> pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < initialPoolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                return pooledObjects[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If we've run out of inactive objects, create a new one\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\n2. Connect this pool to your ARAnchoring script. You'll need to create an array of pools for different types of planes, but for now, let's assume you have just one pool:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARAnchoring : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObjectPool planePool;\n    //...\n}\n```\n3. Then you can replace planeObject creation line in the Update method with getting objects from the pool:\n\n```csharp\n// FIXED CODE:\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if (m_DetectedPlane == null)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n    else if (m_DetectedPlane.SubsumedBy != null)\n    {\n        gameObject.SetActive(false); // deactivate gameObject instead of destroying\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    else if (m_DetectedPlane.TrackingState != TrackingState.Tracking || ARAnchoring.isVR)\n    {\n        m_MeshRenderer.enabled = false;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    m_MeshRenderer.enabled = true;\n    _UpdateMeshIfNeeded();\n}\n```\n4. Then, in the original code where instances are created, replace the Instantiate() calls with planePool.GetPooledObject() calls:\n\n```csharp\nif (Frame.Raycast(Screen.width*0.5f, Screen.height*0.5f, raycastFilter, out hit))\n{\n    //...\n    var planeObject = planePool.GetPooledObject();\n    planeObject.transform.position = hit.Pose.position;\n    planeObject.transform.rotation = hit.Pose.rotation;\n    planeObject.GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n    planeObject.SetActive(true);\n}\n```\nThis way, you ensure that only active objects are using memory. When an inactive object needs to be used again, it can just be brought back to life by being set to active and their current state is maintained."
