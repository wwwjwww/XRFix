Here's the fixed code that addresses this issue:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Compute<T> : Dispatcher\n{\n    private readonly object locker = new object();\n    volatile bool got_answer;\n    public volatile bool interrupt;\n    T result;\n\n    public delegate T RunDelegate();\n    public delegate T RunDelegateWithCompute(Compute<T> compute);\n\n    public Compute(RunDelegate run_delegate)\n    {\n        Schedule(() =>\n        {\n            T result1 = run_delegate();\n            lock (locker)\n            {\n                result = result1;\n                got_answer = true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the Compute<T> class...\n}\n```\n\nI've added a private `locker` object to be used for locking instead of `this`. This ensures that locking is confined to this instance of `Compute<T>` and does not conflict with any external code that might also attempt to lock on the same object."
