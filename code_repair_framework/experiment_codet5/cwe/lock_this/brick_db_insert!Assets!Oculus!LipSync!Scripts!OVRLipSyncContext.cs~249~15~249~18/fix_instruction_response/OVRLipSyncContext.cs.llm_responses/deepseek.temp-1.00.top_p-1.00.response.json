    "code_repairing_0": "I noticed your code has some indentation issues. It appears that you may have used tabs to indent instead of spaces. In C#, it is recommended to use spaces for indentation instead of tabs. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n[RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))]\npublic class OVRLipSyncContext : OVRLipSyncContextBase\n{\n    // your code here\n}\n```\n\nIf you have any specific questions regarding this code, feel free to ask.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you've accidentally left off a few methods and variables from the code you've provided. However, based on the context, I've recreated the missing methods and their implementations:\n\nMissing method 1: `ProcessAudioSamples`.\n\nThis one seems to be missing due to a misinterpretation of the context. However, based on your provided code, it seems like you're trying to process audio samples which are of type `float`. If you need it to process short audio samples, you may copy the following code into your project:\n\n```csharp\npublic void ProcessAudioSamples(short[] data, int channels)\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            return;\n        }\n        var frame = this.Frame;\n        OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMissing method 2: `DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter`.\n\nThis method appears to display the viseme scores and laughter scores in the OVRLipSyncDebugConsole if it exists. Here's an implementation you can use:\n\n```csharp\nvoid DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter()\n{\n    if (showVisemes && hasDebugConsole)\n    {\n        string visemes = \"\";\n        for (int i = 0; i < this.Frame.Visemes.Length; i++)\n        {\n            visemes += this.Frame.Visemes[i] + \" \";\n        }\n        OVRLipSyncDebugConsole.Log(\"VISEMES: \" + visemes);\n    }\n    if (showLaughter && hasDebugConsole)\n    {\n        OVRLipSyncDebugConsole.Log(\"LAUGHTER SCORE: \" + laughterScore);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code loops through the visemes array (if enabled) and logs them to the console. It then logs the laughter score (if enabled).",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems you're trying to process audio samples but you have two methods, one with float array and the other one with short array. This is probably a mistake. The correct method should be consistent with the data type that you receive. You also need to call the correct OVRLipSync function based on your audio data type. Let's stick with float for this situation.\n\nHere is the corrected ProcessAudioSamplesRaw method:\n\n```csharp\npublic void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw(float[] data, int channels)\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            return;\n        }\n        var frame = this.Frame;\n        OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method is called with float data for audio processing.\n\nIn the OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame method, the first parameter is the context of the OVRLipSync (OVRLipSync.Context) which you have not initialized yet. The second parameter is the audio data, the third parameter is the frame where visemes and laughter scores will be stored, and the fourth parameter is a boolean indicating whether the audio is stereo. Make sure you pass the correct parameters to the OVRLipSync functions.\n\nPlease note that the OVRLipSync library requires the audio data to be in the range of -1 to 1. If your audio data is in a different range, you may need to normalize it before passing it to OVRLipSync.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Based on your code, it appears you have an issue with the `ProcessAudioSamplesRaw` method. It seems like you have attempted to overload the method for both `float[]` and `short[]` types. However, this is not allowed in C#. At compile time, the compiler cannot determine which method to call because they have the same parameters.\n\nYou can solve this by having a single method that takes a generic type parameter, like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw<T>(T[] data, int channels) where T : struct\n{\n    if (!audioLoopback)\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; ++i)\n            data[i] = data[i] * 0.0f;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, `ProcessAudioSamplesRaw` will work with both `float` and `short` arrays because of the generic type parameter `T`. \n\nPlease make sure to adjust your code to this new method signature.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you've cut off part of your script. The `ProcessAudioSamplesRaw` method was cut off. Here is the rest of the script:\n\n```csharp\n        public void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw(short[] data, int channels)\n        {\n            lock (this)\n            {\n                if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n                {\n                    return;\n                }\n                var frame = this.Frame;\n                OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter()\n        {\n            if (showVisemes || showLaughter)\n            {\n                string visemes = OVRLipSync.FrameToString(this.Frame);\n                if (hasDebugConsole)\n                {\n                    OVRLipSyncDebugConsole.Log(visemes);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    Debug.LogWarning(\"Warning: No OVRLipSyncDebugConsole in the scene!\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        public void ToggleAudioLoopback()\n        {\n            audioLoopback = !audioLoopback;\n        }\n\n        protected virtual void LocalTouchEventCallback(int controllerIndex, OVRTouchpad touchpad, int button, int deviceType, float delta, float primaryPos, float secondaryPos, bool primaryIsNewPress, bool secondaryIsNewPress)\n        {\n            if (button == 0)\n            {\n                ToggleAudioLoopback();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis script is controlling the audio processing and displaying visemes and laughter scores. It checks for certain key presses for a number of different functionalities. For example, pressing the `L` key will toggle the audio loopback. Pressing the `D` key will enable or disable viseme score display. Pressing the left or right arrow key will adjust the gain of the audio.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or if there are any specific parts of this script you would like me to explain."
