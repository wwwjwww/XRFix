The GetResult method will block until the calculation has completed and the result is available.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The code you have provided seems incomplete and contains a few syntax errors. My interpretation is that you want to complete the `Compute<T>` class with a constructor and methods to get the result of the computation. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Compute<T> : Dispatcher\n{\n    volatile bool got_answer;\n    public volatile bool interrupt;\n    T result;\n\n    public delegate T RunDelegate();\n    public delegate T RunDelegateWithCompute(Compute<T> compute);\n\n    public Compute(RunDelegate run_delegate)\n    {\n        Schedule(() =>\n        {\n            T result1 = run_delegate();\n            lock (this)\n            {\n                result = result1;\n                got_answer = true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public Compute(RunDelegateWithCompute run_delegate)\n    {\n        Schedule(() =>\n        {\n            T result1 = run_delegate(this);\n            lock (this)\n            {\n                result = result1;;\n                got_answer = true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public T GetResult()\n    {\n        while (!got_answer)\n        {\n            if (interrupt)\n                return default(T);\n        }\n\n        lock (this)\n        {\n            return result;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, please note the second constructor `RunDelegateWithCompute` is calling itself in the lambda expression which can create an infinite loop. To fix this issue you need to pass an instance of `Compute<T>` to the delegate.\n\nPlease also note the usage of `lock (this)`. This is a common pattern, but it isn't safe in the `Dispatcher.Schedule` method because it could grab the lock while another thread is in the middle of `Schedule`, causing a deadlock. Consider using a `Monitor` or `Mutex` instead.\n\nThis code assumes that the `Dispatcher.Schedule` method only adds Dispatchers to the queue and sets `bkgnd_thread_dispatcher_working` to `true`. If it does more than that, then `bkgnd_thread_dispatcher_working` should also protect the queue and `Schedule` should set it to `false` when it's done.",
    "code_repairing_2": "I'm sorry, but your code seems to be cut off at several places. You didn't provide the missing parts. It seems like you are trying to create a compute class that runs a delegate asynchronously and possibly interruptible. The code provided didn't make sense to me because there are multiple errors and missing parts. Could you provide the full context of the code you're working on so I can assist you better?",
    "code_repairing_3": "Here is the fixed code snippet:\n\n```csharp\nresult1 = run_delegate(this);\nlock (this)\n{\n    result = result1;\n    got_answer = true;\n}\n```\n\nIn your original code, you were calling `run_delegate()` without passing `this` as an argument. To make this work, you have to modify the delegate type `RunDelegateWithCompute` to accept a `Compute<T>` object as an argument. Then you can call `run_delegate(this)` to get the result. \n\nPlease note that you need to make sure the `Compute<T>` class is inherited from `Dispatcher` in order to use the `Schedule` method in `Compute<T>`.\n\nAlso, when using `lock (this)` in the `Compute<T>` class, you will be locking on the `Compute<T>` instance itself, which might lead to deadlock if you're acquiring locks in different orders in different contexts. Consider using a dedicated lock object instead.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like your code is incomplete. However, based on your incomplete \"FIXED CODE:\" comment, I understand that you are trying to fix a constructor for the class `Compute<T>`. \n\nBased on your code, it seems like you're trying to execute a delegate (of type `Compute<T>`) in the background. If that's the case, you might be missing the part where this delegate is invoked in the new thread.\n\nHere is a possible fix for your code:\n\n```csharp\npublic Compute(RunDelegate run_delegate)\n{\n    Schedule(() =>\n    {\n        T result = run_delegate();\n        lock (this)\n        {\n            result = result;\n            got_answer = true;\n        }\n    });\n}\n```\n\nPlease make sure to replace `T` with the actual type of your computations. This code assumes that the delegate `run_delegate()` returns a value of type `T`, and that the value is stored in the variable `result`. It also assumes that `got_answer` is set to `true` when the delegate has finished its operation."
