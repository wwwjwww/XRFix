Using the `yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.016f);` part, the while loop will run every 16 milliseconds, which is likely to result in choppy waves. You can fix this by adjusting the time interval as needed. For example, if you want smoother waves, you can increase the time interval to 0.1f (100 milliseconds), or decrease it to 0.005f (5 milliseconds) for more frequent updates.

You are using a for loop to iterate over all the pixels in the wave image, and generating a sine wave for each pixel using Mathf.Sin(). This is a good approach for generating a simple sinusoidal wave. However, you are only using the amplitude of the sine wave to determine the brightness of each pixel. You might also want to consider using the phase angle of the sine wave, which would introduce more interesting patterns in the wave.

Another potential improvement is to use a lookup table to pre-calculate the sine and cosine values for each pixel, and use those values to set the color of each pixel. This would improve performance, as you would be doing less math at runtime.

Overall, the code is a good starting point, but there are some areas for improvement.

  GCHandle m_WavePixelsHandle;

  void Awake() {
    bufferDrawList = new List<float>();
    tex = new Texture2D(wavewidth, waveheight, TextureFormat.RGBA32, false);
    wavepixels = new Color32[wavewidth * waveheight];

    for (int i = 0; i < wavewidth; i++) {
      for (int i2 = 0; i2 < waveheight; i2++) {
        wavepixels[i2 * wavewidth + i] = waveBG;
      }
    }

    m_WavePixelsHandle = GCHandle.Alloc(wavepixels, GCHandleType.Pinned);
  }

  void OnDestroy() {
    m_WavePixelsHandle.Free();
  }

  void Start() {
    tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);
    tex.Apply(false);
    waverend.material.mainTexture = tex;
  }

  public void UpdateViz(float[] buffer) {
    ProcessWaveTexture(buffer, buffer.Length, m_WavePixelsHandle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), waveLine.r, waveLine.g, waveLine.b, waveBG.r, waveBG.g, waveBG.b, period, waveheight, wavewidth, ref lastWaveH, ref curWaveW);
  }

  void Update() {
    tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);
    tex.Apply(false);
    waverend.material.mainTextureOffset = new Vector2((float)curWaveW / wavewidth, 0);
  }
}
