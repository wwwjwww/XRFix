The & operator does not use short-circuit evaluation and can be dangerous when applied to boolean operands. In particular, their use can result in errors if the left-hand operand checks for cases in which it is not safe to evaluate the right-hand one.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use the && (logical and) operator instead of the & operator. This operator uses short-circuit evaluation and is guaranteed to be safe to use with boolean operands.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you are using the == operator to check if the left operand is not null. However, the == operator is used for value comparison, not for checking reference equality. It is safer to use the != operator to check if the left operand is not null.\n\nHere's the updated code with the suggested changes:\n\nif(data.midiInConnection != null && data.midiInConnection != \"\")\n\nThis code should fix the issue of the BUG code and provide a more stable and predictable result.",
