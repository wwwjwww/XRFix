    "code_repairing_0": "I'm sorry, but your question isn't clear. It seems you've posted a piece of code but didn't ask a question. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question? I'm here to help with computer science-related questions.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It appears you've posted a piece of code that includes a Unity script for a keyboard device interface. This script is likely for an interactive keyboard instrument and includes various midi and timeline functionalities. It seems to be missing a closing brace for the 'using' statements, and seems to have a missing closing brace for the code block starting with 'public override void hit(bool on, int ID = -1) {'. \n\nIf you're trying to debug or implement something, please provide the missing pieces for the code to function properly. Otherwise, the code seems fine for its purpose.",
    "code_repairing_2": "I'm sorry, but your code seems to be incomplete or not related to any specific computer science question. I am unable to continue the code as we don't know the purpose of the code here. Please provide more context or specific computer science related question for me to assist you.",
    "code_repairing_3": "There doesn't appear to be a specific question or issue raised. However, based on the provided code snippet, you seem to be implementing a keyboard-like device interface in Unity, with features like toggling mute, handling musical events (including midi note hit), and saving/loading data. \n\nThis code seems to be part of a larger system and may require additional context or specific code to fully understand or debug. If you have a specific question or issue, such as a piece of code not working as expected, please provide more details so I can assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Your code is incomplete and doesn't seem to be asking a question. However, if you have a specific question about Unity or C# programming, I'll be glad to help."
