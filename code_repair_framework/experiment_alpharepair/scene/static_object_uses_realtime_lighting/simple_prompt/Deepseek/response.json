    "code_repairing_0": "Apologies for any misunderstanding, but your question seems to be incomplete. You've mentioned that the scene file is written in YAML language, but you are asking to fix YAML code and mentioning a section for it. It's not clear what specific \"setting\" you're referring to that needs to be fixed. \n\nIf you are asking to fix the 'Light:' section in the YAML file, a common mistake could be missing tabulations. However, based on the information provided, it's not possible to identify what specific setting needs to be fixed.\n\nI'll need more context to provide an accurate answer.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your 'Light' object settings appear to be in YAML format. To make sure Unity can understand and properly apply these settings, you should also include a 'm_EditorData' field with more specific settings for the light. However, these settings often depend on your particular project setup and scene structure. \n\nUnfortunately, without a full description or a screenshot of your exact current setup, it is impossible to provide a code snippet specific to your issue. If 'm_Lightmapping' parameter has an issue that requires fixing, the value for 'm_Lightmapping' should be replaced with the suitable numeric value for the field. Here is an example of how you should structure it:\n\n'''\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 4\n  m_EditorData:\n    m_MovedFromTransform: {}\n    m_HideFlags: 0\n'''\n\nAlways do your own tests after adding those field to ensure that this change applies as you expect to your light behavior.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like there's no specific issue in your YAML snippet. It seems to be just a basic setting for a Unity Light component. If you have more specifications or context about this specific scene or the issue, that could help us provide a more accurate solution.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Sure, I need to see the full YAML file to provide a specific fix. Please provide the full YAML file content.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Apologies for any confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding related to the provided code snippet. The YAML snippet in your question seems to represent a dictionary in Python, which is not possible in YAML. YAML is designed to store key-value pairs, or other compound data structures. Could you please provide a more specific question to the scene file, specifically which part should be fixed and what would you consider as the 'fixed' version of the code?"
