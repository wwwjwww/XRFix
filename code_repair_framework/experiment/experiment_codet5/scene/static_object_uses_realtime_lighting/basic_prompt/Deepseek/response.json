    "code_repairing_0": "```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 3\n```\nThis is a problem related to Unity's real-time and dynamic lighting feature. When the Light Mapping mode is set to Real-Time (m_Lightmapping: 4), Unity calculates lighting in the Unity Editor based on all static and dynamic objects in the scene at the time you want to render the scene. This can be resource intensive and slow if you have a large number of static objects in your scene. The mode 3 (m_Lightmapping: 3) uses baked lighting. This means the lightmap can be calculated ahead of time and stored as a texture that can be applied to the static objects in the scene. This can significantly improve render times and performance when rendering scenes with static objects.",
    "code_repairing_1": "```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 0\n```\n\nThe 4 in the original code likely represents a custom Lightmap setting, and it might be consuming resources for static objects to use real-time lighting. Setting `m_Lightmapping` to 0 might be a good solution. In Unity, 0 represents baked lighting. Please note that this may affect the performance of your game, especially if you don't have enough baked lightmaps.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your request is missing the complete scene file content, so I cannot perform the specific fix you're asking for. However, I can point out a general approach to debugging and fixing Unity scenes in YAML format.\n\nIn Unity, objects with the \"Static\" light usage option in their Inspector will be set to use static lighting by default, using the settings you've specified. This option uses less system resources and is useful when you know the objects won't move.\n\nIf you've a concern about static objects being resource-intensive due to real-time lighting, you can try tweaking your global Light settings. You can lower the global illumination to balance the effect.\n\nI encourage you to provide the whole YAML content for a more specific solution.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like there is no bug related to real-time lighting usage for static objects in the given YAML script. However, the task mentioned has been provided to handle \"resource consuming\" issue for static objects using real-time lighting. If we are to consider this as a potential performance issue, you can try to limit the usage of real-time lights by setting them to static. Here is the 'FIXED:' section for your reference:\n\n```yaml\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 4\n  m_Static: True\n```\nThis setting will make the real-time light not update at runtime anymore. This may offer performance benefits for static objects, but the real-time light will behave like a directional light. If you want more control over the light, you might want to consider using pre-rendered light maps.",
