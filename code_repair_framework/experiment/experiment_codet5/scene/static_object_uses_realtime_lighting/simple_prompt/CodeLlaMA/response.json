    "code_repairing_0": "The YAML code snippet you provided is for a Unity scene file, specifically for the lighting settings. The `m_Lightmapping` parameter is set to 4, which means that the scene is using a custom lighting setup.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can remove the `m_Lightmapping` parameter from the YAML code snippet altogether. The default behavior for a Unity scene is to use the built-in lighting system, which is set to automatic lighting by default. This means that the engine will automatically create and position lights in the scene to provide adequate lighting.\n\nHere's the updated YAML code snippet with the `m_Lightmapping` parameter removed:\n```\nLight:\n```\nWith this fix, the scene will no longer use a custom lighting setup, and the built-in lighting system will be used instead.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The YAML code you provided is for Unity's light mapping settings. The \"m_Lightmapping\" property refers to the lightmapping mode of the light source. The value of this property can be set to one of the following:\n\n* 0: Disabled (no lightmapping)\n* 1: Automatic (uses the default lightmapping mode)\n* 2: ScreenSpace (uses screen-space lightmapping)\n* 3: ScreenSpaceWithShadows (uses screen-space lightmapping with shadows)\n* 4: SphericalHarmonics (uses spherical harmonics lightmapping)\n\nYou can change the value of \"m_Lightmapping\" to any of the above numbers to enable lightmapping for the light source. Here is an example of how to fix the code:\n```\nLightMaps:\n  m_Lightmapping: 2\n```\nThis sets the lightmapping mode to \"ScreenSpace\".",
    "code_repairing_2": "The lightmapping setting should be a string, not an integer. To fix this, change the `4` to `\"Dynamic\"`.\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: \"Dynamic\"\n```\nThis will set the lightmapping mode to dynamic, which is the default value.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The YAML code you provided is not valid. The `Light` key is not properly indented, and the `m_Lightmapping` value is not enclosed in quotes.\n\nHere is the fixed code:\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: \"4\"\n```\nNote that the `Light` key is now indented according to the YAML syntax, and the `m_Lightmapping` value is enclosed in quotes to ensure it is treated as a string.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 2\n```\nThe code snippet under the \"FIXED:\" section should be replaced with the following corrected code:\n```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 2\n```\nThis change sets the value of the \"m_Lightmapping\" property to 2, which indicates that the light is using static lightmapped baked lighting."
