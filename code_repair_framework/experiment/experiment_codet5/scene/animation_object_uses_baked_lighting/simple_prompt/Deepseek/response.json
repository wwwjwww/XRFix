    "code_repairing_0": "The problem you're asking for could be a bit confusing because it doesn't provide a specific scene file to work on, but I'll attempt to help. The snippet you provided is in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). It seems like you're trying to configure settings for an Animator in a Unity Application, but you have not provided a fully formed YAML structure. Here's an example of how it could look:\n\n```yaml\n# Unity YAML scene file\n\nAnimator@4473752085:\n  m_ObjectName: Animator\n  m_CorrespondingClip: \n  m_LocalRotation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}\n  m_LocalScale: {x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 1.0}\n  m_LocalPosition: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}\n  m_PrefabInstance: {fileID: 0, guid: 0000000000000000e000000000000000, type: 3}\n  Animation:\n  Avatar@4473752085:\n    m_ObjectName: \n    m_CorrespondingClip: \n    m_LocalRotation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}\n    m_LocalScale: {x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 1.0}\n    m_LocalPosition: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}\n    m_PrefabInstance: {fileID: 0, guid: 0000000000000000e000000000000000, type: 3}\n    m_HideFlags: 0\n  m_HideFlags: 0\n\nLight@4473752085:\n  m_ObjectName: Light\n  m_LocalRotation: {x: 1.45228509, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 0.443320321}\n  m_LocalScale: {x: 2.0, y: 2.0, z: 2.0}\n  m_LocalPosition: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}\n  m_PrefabInstance: {fileID: 0, guid: 0000000000000000e000000000000000, type: 3}\n  m_Lightmapping: 2\n  m_HideFlags: 0\n\nDefault Identifier: \"Assets/Resources/Default.unity\"\nActiveScene: \n  m_SceneName: \"SampleScene\"\n  m_RootGameObjects: [4473752085]\n  m_BehaviourOverrideUsers: []\n  m_EditorData: \n  m_SceneId: 6391258603401134452\n  m_PathETag: 0x5d\n  m_SceneIndex: -1\n```\n\nIn this example, 'Animator' is a component attached to a GameObject in the scene, and 'Light' is another component, also attached to a GameObject. The `m_Lightmapping` is a parameter of the 'Light' component. Setting `m_Lightmapping: 2` will change the lightmapping mode of the light, but it's unclear from your original YAML snippet what you want to change. If you can provide a more detailed version of your original YAML snippet or the behavior you are trying to improve, I'd be happy to help.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Since I'm not aware of the specific Unity scene settings that need to be fixed in your example, I'll provide a general solution. You need to specify the settings that are to be fixed. I'm assuming you want to change the `m_Lightmapping` to `1`, here is how the fixed code snippet could look like:\n\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 1\n```\n\nRemember to replace \"...\" with the correct indentation for your project as YAML is all about preserving the structure of your document. In general, you'll want your YAML document to look something like this:\n\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n  <setting1>: <value1>\n  <setting2>: <value2>\n  ...\nLight:\n  <setting3>: <value3>\n  m_Lightmapping: 1\n```\n\nWithout more information about what needs to be fixed, I'm unable to provide a more precise answer.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The provided YAML file seems to be incomplete. However, I can provide a general fix for a common issue in YAML, which is improper use of indentation. It appears your snippet might have been formatted incorrectly, which might cause errors. Here is the fixed version of your YAML file:\n\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n  ...\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 2\n```\n\nPlease provide a more accurate snippet of your file if you need more specific help.",
    "code_repairing_3": "I apologize for the confusion, but there's nothing to fix on the provided script. It seems to be a mix of configuration settings related to an animator and a light component in a Unity scene. However, without specific requirements or details about what exactly the requirements for the settings are, I would need more context. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a solution. \n\nIf you could provide more details or examples of the settings that should exist or how they should be configured, I would be happy to help!",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 2\n```"
