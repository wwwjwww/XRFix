    "code_repairing_0": "It appears you have posted a part of the code which includes setting up an OVRLipSyncContextBase, but it is incomplete. In order to understand the code properly, can you finish the rest of the code?",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your code seems to be incomplete. However, based on what you provided, it appears that you are trying to create an OVRLipSync context using Unity and the OVRLipSync plugin. \n\nThe code you provided does not appear to be complete, so I am not sure what functionality you're trying to achieve with this code. The `SetSmoothing` function is defined with a getter and setter as well as the `Context` property. It appears to be set to return the context and set the viseme smoothing with a given value. The audio source seems to be not assigned in the code and the `Awake()` function is commented out. \n\nThis code seems to be part of a larger system where it is used to provide auditory input for some kind of speech recognition system. If you post more of your code, I might be able to give you a better understanding of what you are trying to achieve.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you're trying to set up the visibility options and audio source for a Unity project that uses OVRLipSync for context-based phoneme prediction. The code you provided seems incomplete, and you're missing the `Start` and `Update` methods. \n\nIn the `Start` method, you might create a context using the `OVRLipSync.CreateContext` function. \n\nIn the `Update` method, you might periodically check for new audio data and update the `frame` variable using `OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame` function.\n\nHere is a basic example of what the `Start` and `Update` methods might look like assuming you have the OVRLipSync library set up and ready:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Start()\n{\n    if (!audioSource)\n    {\n        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();\n    }\n    \n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context == 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration)\n                != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Start ERROR: Could not create\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n                return;",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like you're trying to set your OVRLipSync context but the code is missing some parts and also using an outdated API. I will provide an example of creating an OVRLipSync context in a more current format. \n\n```csharp\npublic partial class OVRLipSyncContext : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public OVRLipSync.SupportedContextType contextType = OVRLipSync.SupportedContextType.Phonemes;\n    public OVRLipSync.ContextProviders provider = OVRLipSync.ContextProviders.Enhanced;\n    public bool enableDspOffload = true;\n    public bool enableWordRecognition = true;\n\n    private OVRLipSync.Handle handle;\n    private uint context = 0;    // 0 is no context\n\n    private void Awake()\n    {\n        if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, \n            GetContextFlags(enableDspOffload, enableWordRecognition), out handle) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContext.Awake ERROR: Could not create\" + contextType + \" context.\");\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private OVRLipSync.ContextFlags GetContextFlags(bool enableDspOffload, bool enableWordRecognition)\n    {\n        OVRLipSync.ContextFlags flags = OVRLipSync.ContextFlags.None;\n\n        if (enableDspOffload)\n        {\n            flags |= OVRLipSync.ContextFlags.DspOffload;\n        }\n\n        if (enableWordRecognition)\n        {\n            flags |= OVRLipSync.ContextFlags.WordRecognition;\n        }\n\n        return flags;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates a context that can be used to track phrases or phonemes in real-time. The context type, provider, and flags for DSP offload and word recognition are all configurable. \n\nPlease check the Unity OVRLipSync package documentation for more details on how to use this context with your audio source: https://docs-ovrlipsync.secondmind.com/en/latest/group__ovrlipsync__context.html",
    "code_repairing_4": "Your code seems to be incomplete and has some missing parts. It seems like you're trying to create an OVRLipSyncContextBase class in Unity, which is a subclass of MonoBehaviour. However, your code is not complete, so it's hard to say exactly what you're trying to achieve.\n\nHowever, based on what you have, it appears you might be trying to implement an audio context for a text-to-speech (TTS) system, possibly using the OVRLipSync library. If so, you would need to implement the Update method and possibly others. Also, it seems like you might need to implement these methods to interact with the context:\n\n- OVRLipSync.CreateContext: This method is used to create a new lip sync context.\n- OVRLipSync.SendSignal: This method sends a signal to the context. In this case, you might be setting the viseme smoothing, which controls the smoothness of the viseme detection.\n\nAs this is C# code, I've added the missing parts assuming you want to create a context and set the viseme smoothing:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Awake()\n{\n    if (!audioSource)\n    {\n        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();\n    }\n\n    // Ensure the audio source is playing\n    if (!audioSource.isPlaying)\n    {\n        audioSource.Play();\n    }\n\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context == 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Start ERROR: Could not create Phoneme context.\");\n                return;\n           \t}\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (context != 0)\n    {\n        OVRLipSync.Result result = OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(context, frame);\n\n        if (result == OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            // Process the frame here...\n        }\n        else if (result != OVRLipSync.Result.Busy)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Update ERROR: ProcessFrame returned \" + result.ToString());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will create a context when the game object is activated (Awake), and it will process the audio frame every frame (Update). The context creation is done under a lock to ensure that only one thread can create a context at a time.\n\nKeep in mind that this is heavily dependent on the OVRLipSync library you're using. The library might not have a Result.Busy, or a ProcessFrame method, or anything could be named differently in the library's API, so please refer to the library's documentation for accurate information."
