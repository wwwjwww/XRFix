The proper way to fix this is to create a private object to be used as the lock instead.\n\nBelow the \"FIXED CODE:\" comment, we should declare a private object to serve as the lock and change the locking in the `Compute` class to use this object instead of `this`. Here's how you could fix the code:\n\n```csharp\n// ... previous code\n\npublic class Compute<T> : Dispatcher\n{\n    volatile bool got_answer;\n    public volatile bool interrupt;\n    T result;\n\n    private readonly object locker = new object(); // Private locker object\n\n    public delegate T RunDelegate();\n    public delegate T RunDelegateWithCompute(Compute<T> compute);\n\n    public Compute(RunDelegate run_delegate)\n    {\n        Schedule(() =>\n        {\n            T result1 = run_delegate();\n            lock (locker) // Lock on the private locker object\n            {\n                result = result1;\n                got_answer = true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public Compute(RunDelegateWithCompute run_delegate)\n    {\n        Schedule(() =>\n        {\n            T result1 = run_delegate(this);\n            lock (locker) // Lock on the private locker object\n            {\n                result = result1;\n                got_answer = true;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Rest of the methods and properties...\n}\n\n// ... rest of the code\n```\n\nWith this change, the locking mechanism is now considered safe because the lock object is private and specific to instances of `Compute<T>`. This prevents the lock from being accessible to external classes, reducing the chances of introducing synchronization issues."

This approach avoids potential issues with locking on the publicly accessible `this` reference and adheres to best practices for multithreading in C#.
