    "code_repairing_0": "The provided code seems to be complete for the OVRLipSyncContextBase class except for the `OnDestroy` method. If you want to destroy the context when the game object is destroyed, you can add the `OnDestroy` method as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method will be called when the GameObject this script is attached to is about to be destroyed. The context will be destroyed to free up resources. Be aware, though, that if the context is not destroyed, you will get errors in subsequent frames of OVRLipSync as the context has been already destroyed.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It appears that the code you provided is incomplete. It appears you are attempting to create a context for OVRLipSync, but you are missing the logic to properly update the context when a new audio clip is played or stopped.\n\nWithout complete code, I'm unable to provide additional insights. However, it's generally a good practice to call `OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context)` in the `OnDestroy` or `OnDisable` methods to clean up when the component is destroyed or disabled.\n\nIf you have the code for playing a new audio clip, you can use that to create a new context. If you are stopping the audio, you can destroy the current context.\n\nIf you provide more complete code, I can provide more specific guidance.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It looks like you're working with the OVRLipSync library which is part of the Oculus SDK. You may have a problem with the context creation or destruction. Here is the OnDestroy method you may need to use:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                                \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n            context = 0; // Reset the context to 0 after deleting it\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that when the object is destroyed, the context is correctly destroyed as well. Please remember, if there's any other part of your code reference the context, you should make sure that the context is set to 0 after it's destroyed.",

The `OnDestroy` method, or you can use `OnApplicationQuit` might be a good place to call this. Here is the adjusted code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnApplicationQuit()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnApplicationQuit ERROR: Could not delete Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will destroy the context when the application exits (either through the Unity Editor, or by closing the application)."
