    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you've posted a C# script for a Unity game. This script is in charge of detecting when a brick is being held and attached to other bricks. Specifically, it checks for connections between male and female connectors. \n\nThe script detects collisions for the bricks using the BoxCollider components attached to the game object it's attached to. It handles events for when the bricks are grabbed and released, checking if the connected bricks can be attached, adjusting their positions and rotations, and applying a haptic feedback to the user.\n\nThere are also some methods to check if a brick can be connected based on available female and male connectors, as well as methods to calculate new positions and rotations for the bricks.\n\nIt seems to have some debug functionality for visualizing the detection areas of the bricks with gizmos.\n\nOverall, this script handles the brick attachment behavior in a XR-based interactive game environment. If you need further assistance on specifying functionality or fixing a bug, please provide more detailed information about what you're looking to achieve or what specific problem you're encountered.",
    "code_repairing_2": "This script appears to be a Unity C# script for a physical brick object. It's designed to handle interactions with a Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit. \n\nHere is a brief breakdown of its functionality:\n\n1. It has a `BrickAttachDetector` class with several public and private properties and methods.\n\n2. When an object with this script is grabbed, the `BrickGrabbed` method is called. It sets the brick as being held and disables gravity and enables triggers on its colliders. It also adds the brick to the `OwnedPhysicsBricksStore`.\n\n3. When the object is released, the `BrickReleased` method is called. It first checks if the brick can be connected to another brick. If it can, it tries to connect the bricks and if it succeeds, it triggers haptic feedback. If not, it enables gravity on the brick.\n\n4. The `CheckIfCanConnect` method is used to check if the brick can be connected to another one. \n\n5. The `OnDrawGizmos` method is used to display the brick's colliders in the Unity editor.\n\n6. There are methods for checking connection validity, getting new positions and rotations after connection, checking collision with other bricks, and more.\n\nPlease note that the code is incomplete and there are some missing properties and methods that are not shown here. It might need additional methods or properties to fully implement its intended function.",
    "code_repairing_3": "This script is a part of a Unity software using C# programming language. It is designed to be attached to a game object in a Unity scene. Here's a brief explanation of its functionality:\n\n1. **Brick Attach Detection:** This script detects when a brick (game object) is being held and attached. It also checks if the brick is connected to another brick.\n\n2. **Haptics:** If the bricks are successfully connected, haptics are played on the connected brick.\n\n3. **Collision Detection:** The script has methods to handle collision between bricks. It disables collision checks until bricks are released and checks if a brick collides with other bricks when being held.\n\n4. **Connections:** The script handles brick connections. It checks if the brick can connect to another brick. If it can, it calculates the new position and rotation of the brick based on the connection and checks if the brick collides with other bricks in its new position.\n\n5. **Exception Handling:** If there are any problems (like an explosion), it catches the exception and logs the exception message, stack trace, and session type to help debug the issue.\n\n6. **Gizmos Draw:** This script has a method to draw gizmos in Unity editor to visualize the brick's colliders.\n\nPlease note that this code is incomplete as it appears to be a part of a larger script. You might need the rest of the code to fully understand its functionality.",
    "code_repairing_4": "This script is written in C# and is designed to be used with Unity and Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit. It is meant to be attached to a brick object that can be interacted with in an XR environment. \n\nThe script contains several public variables like `maleConnectorParent`, `femaleConnectorParent` and `model` which might refer to the parent object of male or female connectors and the 3D model of the brick respectively. These could be set in the Unity inspector.\n\nThe script also has several private variables like `_collisionExtents`, `_colliderOffset`, `_transform`, `_hapticsManager`, `_xrGrabInteractable`, `_ownedPhysicsBricksStore`, `colliders`, etc.\n\nThe script contains event listeners for the `onSelectEnter` and `onSelectExit` events of the `XRBaseInteractable` component. When the brick is grabbed, the script enables physics for the brick and adds it to the owned physics bricks store. When the brick is released, the script checks if the brick can be connected to another brick and if so, connects them. If not, it enables gravity for the brick.\n\nThe brick will snap to another brick if the other brick is not obstructed by any other bricks. The position and rotation of the brick when connecting are calculated by the `CheckIfCanConnect` method. The brick's model and scale are taken into account in this process. \n\nFinally, the script has an `OnDrawGizmos` method that is used to draw gizmos in the Unity editor. This method is used for debugging, so it could display the bounding boxes of the brick's colliders if set in the inspector."
