    "code_repairing_1": "The code provided appears to be a Unity C# script that is used to manage various tasks related to XR (Extended Reality) development and builds using Oculus, OpenXR, and other SDKs.\n\nThe script includes conditional compilation based on various conditions on whether different XR SDKs (Oculus, OpenXR, etc.) are being used and sets a callback order to control the execution order of this script during different build events.\n\nThe script initializes and logs various events during the build process. It also checks if certain conditions are met, such as if OpenXR is being used while Oculus is enabled and throws a BuildFailedException if not.\n\nThe script then checks if Android Vulkan API is being used, if so, it throws a BuildFailedException.\n\nNext, it checks if the OpenXR is being used with Oculus, if so, it logs a warning. In the end, it generates a unique GUID for each build session and logs this in a file.\n\nThe script then defines methods for controlling a boolean value that determines if Auto Increment Version Code feature is enabled. This feature is used to automatically increase the Android app's version code every time a build is performed.\n\nOverall, this script provides a good degree of functionality for managing XR SDKs and related tasks during build processes in a Unity project.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code appears to be a C# script using Unity and the Oculus XR SDK. It appears to be set up to handle various build processes and XR SDK related tasks. This includes checking for certain conditions, setting build settings, and creating build sessions.\n\nHere's a general overview of what this script does:\n\n1. It defines some preprocessor directives (`#if` statements) to handle different configurations for different platforms/builds.\n2. It initializes the `OVRGradleGeneration` class, assigning it behaviors that respond to certain Unity events like building.\n3. It includes methods to handle actions like toggling auto-incrementing of the Android app version code.\n4. It sets up a static block that listens for the `EditorApplication.delayCall` event. This event is triggered after Unity initialization and before the first frame is rendered.\n5. It includes various methods related to build preprocessing, postprocessing, and generating Gradle build scripts for Android.\n\nIf you have more specific questions about any part of this script, feel free to ask!",
    "code_repairing_3": "This code is part of a Unity project and it is a part of a build process that's checking and managing various aspects of the build, such as using different XR SDKs or building for Android with specific features and settings. \n\nHowever, your text is cut off and it doesn't finish on the second code segment you have provided. If you could provide the completion of the code, I would be able to understand it better and provide a more precise explanation. \n\nIt appears to be an overly complicated and convoluted script, with many parts checking various conditions and then throwing exceptions if certain build conditions are not met, which I suspect are not necessary for the intended purpose of managing Android builds for Oculus or OpenXR SDKs. \n\nThese scripts could be written more simply if the requirements were clearer. However, it's a good practice to keep scripts as simple as possible since they can become difficult to debug when they are complex.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like your code is related to an Unity project, specifically to some kind of XR (Extended Reality) related code. This is for creating a build process in Unity that interacts with the OculusVR or OpenXR SDKs. However, your code seems to be cut off at the end. Could you please provide the rest of the code or explain the context? That way I can assist you better and give you the best possible response."
