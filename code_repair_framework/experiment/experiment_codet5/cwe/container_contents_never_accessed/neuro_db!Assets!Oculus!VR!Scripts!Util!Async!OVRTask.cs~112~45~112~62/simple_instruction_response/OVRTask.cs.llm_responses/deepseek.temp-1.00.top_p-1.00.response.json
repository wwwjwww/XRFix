    "code_repairing_0": "The code you provided appears to be dealing with a custom implementation of a generic task (OVRTask) for a specific project or library. It provides methods to create and manage tasks, as well as provide the ability to set or get the result of a task.\n\nHowever, there is no complete piece of code present. It appears to be missing the implementation of some methods or the completion of some parts of the task. \n\nPlease provide the missing parts of the code, or clarify the part of your question so I can provide a more detailed response.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you've pasted a large code snippet and I see that you have an incomplete method called `AddToPending` in your code. Here is a way to complete it based on the rest of the provided code:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void AddToPending()\n{\n    lock (Pending)\n    {\n        if (!Pending.Contains(Id))\n        {\n            Pending.Add(Id);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"Task is already pending\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this method, it adds the ID of the OVRTask to the Pending Hashset. If an ID is already contained in the Hashset, it throws an Exception to signify that the task is already pending.\n\nPlease replace the `throw new Exception(\"Task is already pending\");` part with appropriate handling depending on your application's needs. The code above is just a starting point and might need adjusting based on your requirements.",
