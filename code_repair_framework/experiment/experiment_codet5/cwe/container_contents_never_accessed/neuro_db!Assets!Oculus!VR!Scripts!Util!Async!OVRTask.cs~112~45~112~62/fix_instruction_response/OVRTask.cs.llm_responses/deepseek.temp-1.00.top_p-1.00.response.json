Its purpose is to manage different tasks and their results in a way that can be accessed more easily in other parts of the code.\n\nThe tasks are identified by a `Guid`, a unique identifier for each task. A dictionary is used to hold all the tasks and their corresponding results. The tasks are also stored in a `HashSet` to ensure that they are not present multiple times.\n\nThe class also provides methods to add callbacks that will be invoked when the task is completed. These callbacks are used to handle the task's result.\n\nMoreover, the class also provides methods to subscribe to the task's completion (with the `OnCompleted` method), which allows the client code to specify an action that will be performed once the task is completed.\n\nThis class is designed to be used inside the Oculus Runtime, a Unity plugin designed to work with the Oculus VR SDK. The Oculus Runtime is responsible for triggering the completion of the task.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems that you have a large code block where some of the collections are never queried or accessed. Here are the solutions for your problem:\n\n1. `Pending` collection: If you need to track pending tasks, you might need to query this collection periodically. Commenting out or removing this collection would depend on the specific requirements of your code.\n\n2. `Results` & `Continuations` collections: These stores the result and continuations of the tasks. They are used when you call `SetResult` method. You should handle them properly in your code.\n\n3. `CallbackInvokers` & `CallbackRemovers` collections: These are used for the `SetContinuation` method. It depends on your usage of these methods.\n\n4. `CallbackClearers` & `InternalDataClearers` collections: You need to clean up these collections when they are no longer needed. You might need to handle this depending on how your code handles the tasks.\n\n5. `SubscriberRemovers` collection: This is used to manage the subscribers for the async tasks. You need to handle it depending on your usage of the async tasks.\n\nPlease note that removing or commenting out these collections or lines depending on your specific application requirements.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It appears that there might be a bug or not-so-optimized usage of these collections. As per your note, the collection 'SubscriberClearers' is commented out, its contents are never accessed. Another collection 'Pending' is being used to hold 'Guid'. These two collections could in fact hold unnecessary data if the related functionality is not being used.\n\nYou may also need to review the other methods where these collections are involved to make sure they are getting used properly.\n\nHere's the commented out 'SubscriberClearers' code snippet:\n\n```csharp\n//Remove or Commented-out the collection if it is no longer needed\n// FIXED CODE:\n// private static readonly HashSet<Action> SubscriberClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n```\n\nAgain, for this code, you would need to ensure that your 'OVRTask<TResult>' class's functionality is using these collections properly, as it seems like they are being created but not being used/emptied.",
