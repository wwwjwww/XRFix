    "code_repairing_0": "The warning is suggesting that you might not be using the `CallbackClearers` and `InternalDataClearers` at all. Although the compiler can't tell if you're using them or not, they are used in your code snippet.\n\nIf you want to remove unused variables from your code without causing compiler warnings, you can just remove them. Here's the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\npublic readonly struct OVRTask<TResult> : IEquatable<OVRTask<TResult>>, IDisposable\n{\n    #region static\n\n    private static readonly HashSet<Guid> Pending = new HashSet<Guid>();\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, TResult> Results = new Dictionary<Guid, TResult>();\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, Action> Continuations = new Dictionary<Guid, Action>();\n\n    private delegate void CallbackInvoker(Guid guid, TResult result);\n\n    private delegate bool CallbackRemover(Guid guid);\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, CallbackInvoker>\n        CallbackInvokers = new Dictionary<Guid, CallbackInvoker>();\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, CallbackRemover>\n        CallbackRemovers = new Dictionary<Guid, CallbackRemover>();\n\n    private static readonly HashSet<Action> CallbackClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n\n    private delegate bool InternalDataRemover(Guid guid);\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover> InternalDataRemovers =\n        new Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover>();\n\n    // BUG: Container contents are never accessed\n    // MESSAGE: A collection or map whose contents are never queried or accessed is useless.\n    //     private static readonly HashSet<Action> InternalDataClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n\n    // FIXED CODE:\n\n```\nThis code will compile and should give you two warnings as they are now unused. You can comment them out if you don't need them.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you want to fix the warning about collections being empty. \n\nThe field `CallbackClearers` and `InternalDataClearers` are empty and they are never used in your code. If you are not using these features, you can safely remove them. \n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\n\ninternal static class OVRTask\n{\n    // ...\n    // Rest of your code here\n}\n\npublic readonly struct OVRTask<TResult> : IEquatable<OVRTask<TResult>>, IDisposable\n{\n    #region static\n\n    private static readonly HashSet<Guid> Pending = new HashSet<Guid>();\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, TResult> Results = new Dictionary<Guid, TResult>();\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, Action> Continuations = new Dictionary<Guid, Action>();\n\n    private delegate void CallbackInvoker(Guid guid, TResult result);\n\n    private delegate bool CallbackRemover(Guid guid);\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, CallbackInvoker> CallbackInvokers = new Dictionary<Guid, CallbackInvoker>();\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, CallbackRemover> CallbackRemovers = new Dictionary<Guid, CallbackRemover>();\n\n    private delegate bool InternalDataRemover(Guid guid);\n\n    private static readonly Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover> InternalDataRemovers = new Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover>();\n}\n```\n\nThis will remove the warning about collections being empty. If you are using other parts of this code which require these empty containers, please specify so that I can help further.",
    "code_repairing_2": "I see the comment about a collection that never gets accessed, it seems that the code was missing some essential parts. It's not clear from your question what changes you want to make to these parts, but here's how a fixed code could look:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\n\ninternal static class OVRTask\n{\n    // ... (your existing code)\n\n    private static readonly HashSet<Action> InternalDataClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n\n    private static void ClearInternalData(Guid guid)\n    {\n        lock (Pending)\n        {\n            if (Pending.Remove(guid))\n            {\n                if (Results.ContainsKey(guid))\n                {\n                    Results.Remove(guid);\n                }\n\n                if (Continuations.ContainsKey(guid))\n                {\n                    Continuations.Remove(guid);\n                }\n\n                if (CallbackInvokers.ContainsKey(guid))\n                {\n                    CallbackInvokers.Remove(guid);\n                }\n\n                if (CallbackRemovers.ContainsKey(guid))\n                {\n                    CallbackRemovers.Remove(guid);\n                }\n\n                if (InternalDataRemovers.ContainsKey(guid))\n                {\n                    InternalDataRemovers.Remove(guid);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    internal static void ClearData(Guid guid)\n    {\n        lock (InternalDataClearers)\n        {\n            InternalDataClearers.Add(() => ClearInternalData(guid));\n        }\n    }\n\n    internal static void ClearAllData()\n    {\n        lock (InternalDataClearers)\n        {\n            foreach (var action in InternalDataClearers)\n            {\n                action();\n            }\n\n            InternalDataClearers.Clear();\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of your existing code)\n}\n```\nIn this added code:\n\n- `ClearInternalData` method is used to remove data related to a specific guid.\n- `ClearData` method adds a `ClearInternalData` delegate to `InternalDataClearers`, which is used to clear data when necessary.\n- `ClearAllData` method clears data for all guids.\n\nPlease take note that this is a simplified version and there could be a better way to manage these collections depending on your specific requirements.",
