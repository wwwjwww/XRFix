    "code_repairing_0": "It looks like there's a missing piece of code in your Unity script. You can add the missing code snippet as below:\n\n```csharp\nif (hitInfo.collider.GetComponent<IgnoreTeleportTrace>() == null)\n{\n    return segmentStartTime + ((hitInfo.distance - (segmentEndPos - segmentStartPos).magnitude) / (segmentEndPos - segmentStartPos).magnitude);\n}\n```\n\nThis code will check if the collider of the hit object has the `IgnoreTeleportTrace` component. If it doesn't, it will calculate the time it takes for the projectile to reach the distance of the hit point. This is used to accurately predict the time of the collision, even if the collision occurs in the 'shadow' of a `IgnoreTeleportTrace` object. Finally, this time is returned, indicating the time of collision.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Please check your code again, it seems like you have incorrectly set the conditions for checking if the hit object should be ignored. \n\nYou should ensure that your object with `IgnoreTeleportTrace` script is properly instanced and set up. If you're certain that this doesn't affect your gameplay, you should replace the comment `// FIXED CODE` with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nif (hitInfo.collider.GetComponent<IgnoreTeleportTrace>() == null)\n```\n\nThis line tells the program to ignore any objects that have `IgnoreTeleportTrace` script attached to them and not count them towards the teleportation arc. The original comment `// FIXED CODE` with the removed code is a placeholder to guide you through the fix. Replace it with the corrected version once you finish the troubleshooting.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code contains a problem that is likely due to a missing variable or condition. The code seems to be incomplete and there's no clear indication of what it should do.\n\nIf you're trying to check if a collision occurred with the Physics.Linecast method, there's no variable indicating whether a collision did occur. You should add a variable to track this, for example with the bool variable `collided`:\n\n```csharp\nbool collided = Physics.Linecast(segmentStartPos, segmentEndPos, out hitInfo, traceLayerMask);\n```\n\nThen you can use `collided` in your code to determine what should happen in the context of your game.\n\nPlease provide more context or code to explain your issue better, so I can give you a more accurate response.",
    "code_repairing_3": "You seem to be missing a piece of the original code that appears to be causing the problem. It seems like there might be a condition where the code checks if the hit object has a component of type IgnoreTeleportTrace, but there isn't any code providing the value of that condition. \n\nAssuming that `hitInfo.collider.GetComponent<IgnoreTeleportTrace>() == null` is the condition where the code should stop drawing the arc, you can add the necessary code to stop the drawing in the else block of the Update() function. \n\nHere is an example of how you might do that:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (thickness != prevThickness || segmentCount != prevSegmentCount)\n    {\n        CreateLineRendererObjects();\n        prevThickness = thickness;\n        prevSegmentCount = segmentCount;\n    }\n\n    if (shouldStopDrawing)  // This should be a variable you set based on your conditions\n    {\n        Hide();\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, I added a condition to call the Hide() function if shouldStopDrawing is true. This variable is what you would set in your conditions that you mentioned, based on your game's specific needs and rules.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you are trying to debug or implement a specific part of the code in Unity. However, I can't see the full context of your code, but here are several general tips to help you:\n\n1. Make sure your projectile is always moving with constant velocity. If it's not, ensure that the velocity of your projectile at each moment is always the same.\n\n2. Always check the conditions for a bad angle ahead of time. If the pointer is at a bad angle, call `SetArcData` function with `pointerAtBadAngle` set to `true`. This will stop the arc from moving and trace it until it hits something.\n\n3. If the arc is moving and the pointer is at a bad angle, the arc will trace a line from its position at the time it started moving, to the position it had just when it hit something. Make sure your `DrawArc` function handles this correctly, particularly the part of the code that draws the line.\n\n4. Remember to call `SetArcData` and `DrawArc` function every frame in the `Update` function.\n\nFor the specific error, you might need to provide more context so I could help you better."
