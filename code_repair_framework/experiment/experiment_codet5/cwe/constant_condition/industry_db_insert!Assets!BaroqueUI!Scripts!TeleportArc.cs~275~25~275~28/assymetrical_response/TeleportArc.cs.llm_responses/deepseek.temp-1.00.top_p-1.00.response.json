    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like your code got cut off after `hitInfo.collider.GetComponent<IgnoreTeleportTrace>() == null)`. Without knowing what `IgnoreTeleportTrace` is, I can't provide a full solution. However, assuming `IgnoreTeleportTrace` is the name of a component that you created that would exclude objects from the teleport trace, you might want to add this to your `FindProjectileCollision` method:\n\n```csharp\nif (hitInfo.collider.GetComponent<IgnoreTeleportTrace>())\n```\n\nThis way, when a teleport trace hits this object, the method will return before checking further. \n\nKeep in mind, if you mean to exclude all objects with the tag \"IgnoreTeleportTrace\", replace the above line of code with:\n\n```csharp\nif (hitInfo.collider.CompareTag(\"IgnoreTeleportTrace\"))\n```\n\nThis will ensure the function will return if a collider with the tag \"IgnoreTeleportTrace\" is hit. Please replace these parts of your code with the corresponding functionalities to the component you want to exclude from the teleport trace.",

    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you are trying to create a teleport arc effect in Unity and visualize it using a LineRenderer. However, your message ended prematurely before I could finish your script. Could you please continue and provide the remainder of your code so I could assist you further?",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like you're trying to set up a line renderer for drawing an arc in Unity. However, the code you provided does not contain the `GetArcPositionAtTime` method which is necessary for calculating the arc path. You need to implement it. \n\nHere's an example of how you could do this:\n\n```csharp\nprivate Vector3 GetArcPositionAtTime(float time)\n{\n    Vector3 position = startPos;\n\n    if (useGravity)\n    {\n        float x = projectileVelocity.x * time;\n        float y = projectileVelocity.y * time - 0.5f * Physics.gravity.y * Mathf.Pow(time, 2f);\n        float z = projectileVelocity.z * time;\n\n        position += new Vector3(x, y, z);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        position += projectileVelocity * time;\n    }\n\n    return position;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `startPos` is the starting position, `projectileVelocity` is the initial velocity, and `useGravity` determines whether gravity should be used when calculating the position. \n\nThe `GetArcPositionAtTime` method calculates the position at the given time by adding the velocity times the time to the starting position, but if gravity should be used, the y component of the velocity is multiplied by the time and the half of gravity times the square of time is subtracted from it.\n\nWith this method, you can draw the arc by calling `DrawArc` method which shows the arc in the Unity editor. \n\nPlease replace `Timed.time` and `Timed.Time.Zero` with `Time.time` and `Time.zero` in your code as they do not exist in Unity. \n\nAlso, it would be helpful if you could specify what exactly your program is supposed to accomplish so that I can assist you better with your code.",
