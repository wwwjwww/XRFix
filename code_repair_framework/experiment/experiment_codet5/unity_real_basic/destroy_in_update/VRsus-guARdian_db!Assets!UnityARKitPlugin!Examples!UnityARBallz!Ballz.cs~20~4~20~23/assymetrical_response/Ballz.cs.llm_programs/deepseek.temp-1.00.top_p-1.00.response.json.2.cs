public class Ballz : MonoBehaviour {

	public float yDistanceThreshold;

	private float startingY;


	void Start () {
		startingY = transform.position.y;
	}
	




It seems like you're missing the code for your "Ballz" class. Could you please provide the complete code so that I can understand your question better? I need to see the `Update()`, `OnCollisionEnter()` etc methods in order to provide an accurate solution.
