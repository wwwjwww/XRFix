    "code_repairing_0": "From your description, it seems that the Update() method in DetectedPlaneVisualizer is being called each frame. The problem here is that you are destroying gameObjects in Update(). This is problematic because Update() can be called multiple times per frame, which can cause unpredictable behavior. \n\nA better approach would be to create a pool of DetectedPlaneVisualizer objects before the game starts. You can then enable/disable these objects based on whether or not they're visible. \n\nHere's a basic structure:\n\n1. Start by creating a prefab for DetectedPlaneVisualizer and a pool container in your scene.\n\n2. In your ARAnchoring script, create a pool of DetectedPlaneVisualizer objects at the start of the game:\n\n```csharp\npublic Transform planeVisualizerPoolParent; // Assign this in inspector\npublic DetectedPlaneVisualizer planeVisualizerPrefab; // Assign this in inspector\nprivate List<DetectedPlaneVisualizer> planeVisualizers;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    planeVisualizers = new List<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n    {\n        DetectedPlaneVisualizer visualizer = Instantiate(planeVisualizerPrefab, planeVisualizerPoolParent);\n        visualizer.Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n        planeVisualizers.Add(visualizer);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. In your Update() method, enable/disable objects in the pool based on visibility:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if (isVR)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Session.GetTrackables<DetectedPlane>(m_AllPlanes);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n    {\n        planeVisualizers[i].gameObject.SetActive(true); // enable the object\n        planeVisualizers[i].Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n    }\n    \n    // Rest of your code...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're not destroying gameObjects in Update() which is more efficient. The pool of DetectedPlaneVisualizer objects are created only once at the start of the game and reused each frame based on visibility. This should help keep the game performance at a reasonable level.",
    "code_repairing_1": "If you are destroying the GameObjects in Update() method, there are several ways to improve the efficiency of your code:\n\n1. Use Object Pooling: You can pool game objects before entering Update(). When a plane is detected, check if there is an available object in the pool. If there isn't, you can instantiate a new one. This way, you avoid costly instantiation/destruction operations in Update().\n\n2. Use Coroutines: Instead of running your code directly in Update(), you can use Coroutines. Coroutines allow you to pause the execution of a function. It can make your code more readable and easier to manage. Once the VR mode is activated, you can wait until the next frame to destroy the planes, instead of destroying them immediately. Here is a [link](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html) to the Unity documentations about coroutines.\n\n3. Modify Update(): Instead of destroying planes in Update(), you can move them to a different list or deactivate them. Then, in a separate method or at a different time, destroy them. This can be more efficient considering the cost of destroying GameObjects. The only inconvenience is that you access the objects during the update, so you need to ensure that this does not cause problems.\n\n4. Use a GameObject Pool: Unity has a component called 'Object Pooler' which you can use to pool your game objects (planes in your case). It can be found in the unity asset store.\n\nI would suggest using the first three methods because they are simpler and they should provide a noticeable performance improvement. It's always a good idea to test and profile your code under different conditions to see what works best in your specific scenario.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Based on the information provided, it seems like you're trying to optimize a code which calls `Destroy()` in a loop, which can be a heavy operation in terms of performance. In Unity, the `Destroy()` function is a costly operation because it also involves destroying the GameObject in the hierarchy and also invoking the `OnDestroy()` method.\n\nA way to optimize this is to use object pools. An object pool is a set of pre-instantiated GameObject that are ready to use and can go back to the pool when they are no longer needed.\n\nHowever, since you are destoying the GameObjects every frame due to the condition `ARAnchoring.isVR` being true, a better solution would actually be to implement some sort of a delay or timer before destroying them. This way, the condition `ARAnchoring.isVR` just needs to be false for the duration of the delay, allowing for the objects to be processed after the VR state has been activated.\n\nIf you are still eager to use an object pool, it could be quite a bit more complex to implement, but here is a basic example of a script using a Generic object pool. It's not directly related to your issue, but might give you some ideas how to implement an object pool:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int initialSize;\n\n    private List<GameObject> pool;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pool.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pool.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                pool[i].SetActive(true);\n                return pool[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n        pool.Add(obj);\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this script, `GetObject()` method returns a GameObject from the pool or creates a new one if all are currently in use. You can adjust this script to fit your needs and use the `GameObject` returned from `GetObject()` in place of `Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform)`.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The issue lies in the fact that you are calling `Destroy()` inside the `Update()` method which is incorrect as it's a Unity method and it runs every frame. When `Update()` is called, it may contain a lot of `Destroy()` calls, this will lead to performance issues. \n\nTo fix this issue, it would be much more efficient to destroy GameObjects after they are no longer needed, such as when the AR Core session ends or a new AR session starts. This can be done using `DestroyObjectPool()`. \n\nHowever, because you are dealing with a script in the ARCore SDK, you may not have access to the `DestroyObjectPool()` function directly. So, you can alternatively use GameObject pooling techniques by creating a GameObject pool before the Update() method has run. Here is a sample piece of code of how to do this:\n\n```csharp\nprivate GameObject[] planeObjects;\n\nvoid Start() {\n   planeObjects = new GameObject[m_AllPlanes.Count];\n   for (int i = 0; i < planeObjects.Length; i++) {\n       planeObjects[i] = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform);\n   }\n}\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n   if (isVR)\n   {\n       return;\n   }\n\n   Session.GetTrackables<DetectedPlane>(m_AllPlanes);\n   for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n   {\n       planeObjects[i].GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n   }\n...\n}\n```\nWith this code, instead of creating new objects in every frame, you reserve the count of planes you will track then initialize all objects at the start. This way, you only create new instances once needed. This may not be the perfect solution for every situation, and there may be more efficient ways to handle this depending on your specific requirements, but this should definitely bring performance improvements over the use of `Destroy()` in the `Update()` method.",
    "code_repairing_4": "You can use an object pool to store the plane objects before they are destroyed in the Update() method. This will prevent destroying objects in every frame by reducing unnecessary operations. \n\nHere's a simple way to do it:\n\n```csharp\npublic GameObject[] PlanePool;\nprivate int currentIndex = 0;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    PlanePool = new GameObject[100]; // Create an array of 100 GameObject slots\n}\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    if (isVR)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Session.GetTrackables<DetectedPlane>(m_AllPlanes);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n    {\n        if(currentIndex >= PlanePool.Length)\n        {\n            // If we've filled our pool, stop instating more planes\n            Debug.LogWarning(\"PlanePool is full. Stopped further plane generation\");\n            break;\n        }\n\n        GameObject planeObject = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform);\n        planeObject.GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(m_AllPlanes[i]);\n\n        // Store the planeObject in our pool\n        PlanePool[currentIndex] = planeObject;\n        currentIndex++;\n    }\n    //... Rest of your code\n}\n```\n\nNow, before `Update()` is called, all plane objects are created and stored in an array `PlanePool`. This way, you can avoid destroying objects in every frame. You might need to add some cleanup code to manage these objects when they are no longer needed (for example, after they are no longer visible to the user).\n\nRemember to initialize `PlanePool` before `Start()` method is called, so it's ready for use. Also, make sure to handle the case where `PlanePool` is full, to avoid an overflow."
