This code uses the `Object.Destroy()` method to destroy the GameObject. The method is called inside the Update() method, which is called at every frame. Using `Object.Destroy()` in this way can cause performance issues, as the Update() method is called multiple times per second and the method can take some time to complete.

To fix this, you can use a coroutine to destroy the GameObject after a short delay. A coroutine is a special type of function that can yield control back to the Unity engine during execution. This allows it to do other things like update the render loop, respond to user input, or animate the game.

Here's an example of how to fix the code using a coroutine:

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have questions or if you need further assistance.
