    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you have a large piece of code missing from your question, and I am not entirely sure what you need help with. However, I can provide you with some guidance based on what I can see.\n\nFrom the provided code, it appears you are implementing a skeleton class for Oculus controllers in Unity using the OVRPlugin.\n\nIt looks like the remaining part of your code should handle updating the bone poses based on the input pose data. \n\nHere's a basic idea of how you might handle this:\n\n```C#\nif (IsDataValid)\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < _bones.Count; ++i)\n    {\n        if (_updateRootPose)\n        {\n            _bones[i].Transform.localPosition = data.RootPose.Position.FromFlippedZVector3f();\n            _bones[i].Transform.localRotation = data.RootPose.Orientation.FromFlippedZQuatf();\n        }\n        if (_updateRootScale)\n        {\n            _bones[i].Transform.localScale = Vector3.one * data.RootScale;\n        }\n        if (i < data.BoneRotations.Length)\n        {\n            _bones[i].Transform.localRotation = data.BoneRotations[i].FromFlippedZQuatf();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code should be placed in the `Update` function. It assumes that `data.BoneRotations` is a valid array, `OVRBone.Transform` is correctly assigned to bone transforms, and the methods `FromFlippedZQuatf` and `FromFlippedZVector3f` are defined somewhere to handle the OVRPlugin quaternion and vector conversions.\n\nI would recommend debugging this part to make sure the quaternions and vectors are being assigned correctly. Also, make sure the `IsDataValid` variable is updated correctly based on the input data. \n\nIf the issue is still not resolved, you might need to specify what exactly you want to achieve so I can provide a more precise answer.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you have posted a part of the code snippet of a C# script that is related to VR skeleton tracking using OVRPlugin by Oculus. This script seems to be related to tracking and visualizing skeleton poses from a VR input device like an Oculus HMD or a VR handheld device. \n\nThis script contains classes, structs, enumerations, properties and methods related to the Oculus VR plugin. It seems to be following best programming practices but there's a slight issue. It would be really helpful if you could specify what exactly you need assistance with. Is there a specific part of it that you're having trouble understanding or implementing?\n\nPlease provide further details so I can provide a more accurate and helpful response.",
