By passing these parameters as references, we can avoid this issue and ensure that the correct values are used.\n\nHere is the fixed code snippet for the \"UpdateViz\" function:\n```\npublic void UpdateViz(float[] buffer) {\n    ProcessWaveTexture(buffer, buffer.Length, m_WavePixelsHandle.AddrOfPinnedObject(), waveLine.r, waveLine.g, waveLine.b, waveBG.r, waveBG.g, waveBG.b, period, waveheight, wavewidth, ref lastWaveH, ref curWaveW);\n}\n```\nThe problem with the original code was that the \"ProcessWaveTexture\" function was not being called correctly. By calling the function with the correct arguments, we can ensure that the correct values are used.\n\nHere is the fixed code snippet for the \"Update\" function:\n```\nvoid Update() {\n    tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);\n    tex.Apply(false);\n    UpdateViz(bufferDrawList.ToArray());\n}\n```\nThe problem with the original code was that the \"bufferDrawList\" variable was being updated incorrectly. By updating the variable correctly, we can ensure that the correct values are used.\n\nOverall, the fixes should resolve the errors and allow the code to function correctly.",

The `Start()` method is called only once when the script is first initialized. In contrast, the `Awake()` method is called every time the script is enabled.\n\nThe ` Start()` method also replaces the `OnDestroy()` method with the `OnDestroy()` method. The `OnDestroy()` method is used for releasing resources when the script is destroyed. In this case, we are not using any resources that need to be released, so we can simply remove this method.\n\nThe ` Update()` method also replaces the `OnDestroy()` method with the `OnDestroy()` method. This method is used to update the texture of the `waveViz` object, and we are not using this method. So we can simply remove this method.\n\nThe `UpdateViz()` method calls the `ProcessWaveTexture()` method, which is responsible for processing the audio buffer and updating the texture of the `waveViz` object. We are not using this method, so we can simply remove this method."
