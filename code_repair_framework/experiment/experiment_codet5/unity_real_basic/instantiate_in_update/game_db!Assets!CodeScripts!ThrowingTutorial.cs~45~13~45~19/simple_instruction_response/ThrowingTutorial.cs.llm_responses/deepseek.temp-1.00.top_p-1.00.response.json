This is how we reset the readyToThrow to true and enable the possibility of throwing again after cooldown time.",

Also, the rotation for the `Instantiate` function has been fixed.\n\nThe `totalThrows` will decrease each time a throw is made, so if you want it to decrease at a different rate or stop at a specific amount of throws, you will need to adjust the conditions inside the IF and ELSE IF statements accordingly.\n\nPlease ensure your `ResetThrow` method is correctly implemented as it's invoked to reset the throwing state after the `throwCooldown`. If not, consider implementing or checking its functionality.",
