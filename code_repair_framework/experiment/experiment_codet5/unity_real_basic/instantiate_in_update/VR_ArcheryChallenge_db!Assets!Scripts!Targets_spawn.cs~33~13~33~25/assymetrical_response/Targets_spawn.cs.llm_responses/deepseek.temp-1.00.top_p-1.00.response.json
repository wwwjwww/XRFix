    "code_repairing_0": "You can solve this problem by using an object pooling technique. An object pool is a collection of pre-instantiated game objects set aside in a game engine that are ready to be toggled on or off as needed. \n\nHere is a modified version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Unity.XR.CoreUtils;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System;\n\npublic class Targets : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject target;\n    public String level; // Integer representing the difficulty level\n    public float spawnInterval = 3f; // Seconds between spawns\n    public int maxTargets = 10; // Max targets allowed in scene\n\n    private float spawnTimer = 0f;\n    private float spawnRange = 5f; // Range for spawning\n\n    private List<GameObject> targetPool;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        level = PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"level\"); // Default to level 1 (\"easy\")\n        targetPool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < maxTargets; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject newTarget = Instantiate(target);\n            newTarget.SetActive(false);\n            targetPool.Add(newTarget);\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        spawnTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n\n        if (spawnTimer >= spawnInterval && GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Target\").Length < maxTargets)\n        {\n            SpawnTarget();\n            spawnTimer = 0f; // Reset the timer\n        }\n    }\n\n    void SpawnTarget()\n    {\n        foreach (GameObject t in targetPool)\n        {\n            if (!t.activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3(\n                    UnityEngine.Random.Range(-spawnRange, spawnRange),  // Random x position\n                    UnityEngine.Random.Range(1f, 5f),       // Random y position between 1 and 5\n                    0);                                     // z axis is  for 2D\n\n                t.SetActive(true);\n                t.transform.position = spawnPosition;\n                t.tag = \"Target\";\n                t.GetComponent<Targets_movements>().level = level;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, I've added a list called targetPool to hold all the instantiated targets. On Start, I've instantiated maxTargets number of targets and turned them off (SetActive(false)) to start. When a target is spawned, it is not instantiated again, instead, it is picked from the pool and turned on at its new spawn position. This way, Update cannot be called every frame since it wouldn't have new targets, and we only spawn as many targets as we have in the pool instead of constantly instantiating new ones.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Certainly, here's how to implement object pooling. This is typically used if you are spawning a large number of objects over time and you want to avoid expensive repeated instantiations. Here is an example:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Targets : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject target;\n    public string level; // Integer representing the difficulty level\n    public float spawnInterval = 3f; // Seconds between spawns\n    public int maxTargets = 10; // Max targets allowed in scene\n\n    private float spawnTimer = 0f;\n    private float spawnRange = 5f; // Range for spawning\n\n    private List<GameObject> targetPool; // List to store spawned targets\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        level = PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"level\"); // Default to level 1 (\"easy\")\n\n        targetPool = new List<GameObject>(); // Initialize the target pool\n\n        StartCoroutine(TargetCoroutine()); // Start the coroutine\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator TargetCoroutine()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            yield return new WaitForSeconds(spawnInterval);\n\n            if (targetPool.Count < maxTargets)\n            {\n                SpawnTarget();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    void SpawnTarget()\n    {\n        Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3(\n            UnityEngine.Random.Range(-spawnRange, spawnRange),  // Random x position\n            UnityEngine.Random.Range(1f, 5f),       // Random y position between 1 and 5\n            0);                                     // z axis is 0 for 2D\n\n        GameObject newTarget = Instantiate(target, spawnPosition, Quaternion.identity);\n        newTarget.tag = \"Target\";\n\n        newTarget.GetComponent<Targets_movements>().level = level;\n\n        targetPool.Add(newTarget); // Add the new target to the pool\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        // If there are objects that are not active in the scene, remove them from the pool\n        targetPool.RemoveAll(item => item == null || !item.activeInHierarchy); \n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated version, a list called `targetPool` is used to store all active targets. The `TargetCoroutine` function is a coroutine that waits for the spawn interval, checks if the number of active targets is less than the maximum, and spawns a new target if possible. The `Update` method checks at each frame if there are objects in the `targetPool` that are not active in the scene and removes them from the pool.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The issue here is that you are using the `Instantiate()` function inside the `Update()` function, which means that it is called every frame. This can lead to performance problems as it can create a large number of game objects over time.\n\nThe solution would be to move the instantiation of the game object to a position where it only needs to be done once, for example in the `Start()` or `Awake()` function. This function is called when the game object is created.\n\nHere's how the fixed code may look like:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing Unity.XR.CoreUtils;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System;\n\npublic class Targets : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject target;\n    public String level; // Integer representing the difficulty level\n    public float spawnInterval = 3f; // Seconds between spawns\n    public int maxTargets = 10; // Max targets allowed in scene\n\n    private float spawnTimer = 0f;\n    private float spawnRange = 5f; // Range for spawning\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        level = PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"level\"); // Default to level 1 (\"easy\")\n\n        if(GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Target\").Length < maxTargets)\n        {\n            SpawnTarget();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        spawnTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n\n        if (spawnTimer >= spawnInterval && GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Target\").Length < maxTargets)\n        {\n            SpawnTarget();\n            spawnTimer = 0f; // Reset the timer\n        }\n    }\n\n    void SpawnTarget()\n    {\n        Vector3 spawnPosition = new Vector3(\n            UnityEngine.Random.Range(-spawnRange, spawnRange),  // Random x position\n            UnityEngine.Random.Range(1f, 5f),       // Random y position between 1 and 5\n            0);                                     // z axis is 0 for 2D\n\n        GameObject newTarget = Instantiate(target, spawnPosition, Quaternion.identity);\n\n        newTarget.tag = \"Target\";\n\n        newTarget.GetComponent<Targets_movements>().level = level;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a new game object at the start of the game and then checks every frame if a new game object should be created. This ensures that the game object is only created once when the game starts and it's not created every frame.",
    "code_repairing_3": "In your code, `Instantiate(target, spawnPosition, Quaternion.identity)` is being called within the `Update()` method. This can lead to performance issues, especially in a frame-based game where `Update()` is called every frame. The `Instantiate()` functions are expensive to execute and should ideally be called less frequently.\n\nHere is a revised version of your code that reduces the number of `Instantiate()` calls:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Start()\n{\n    // ... your existing code ...\n    \n    // Instantiate a pool of targets initially\n    targetPool = new Queue<GameObject>(maxTargets);\n    for (int i = 0; i < maxTargets; i++)\n    {\n        GameObject newTarget = Instantiate(target, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);\n        newTarget.SetActive(false); // Deactivates the object to start\n        targetPool.Enqueue(newTarget); // Adds the object to the pool\n    }\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    spawnTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n\n    if (spawnTimer >= spawnInterval && GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Target\").Length < maxTargets)\n    {\n        if (targetPool.Count > 0) // Ensure we have an available object in the pool\n        {\n            GameObject newTarget = targetPool.Dequeue(); // Retrieve an object from the pool\n            newTarget.SetActive(true); // Activates the object\n\n            // Adjust spawn position and other target properties\n            newTarget.transform.position = new Vector3(\n                UnityEngine.Random.Range(-spawnRange, spawnRange),  \n                UnityEngine.Random.Range(1f, 5f),       \n                0);                                         \n\n            newTarget.tag = \"Target\";\n            newTarget.GetComponent<Targets_movements>().level = level;\n\n            spawnTimer = 0f; // Reset the timer\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, we are creating a pool of `Target` objects and storing them in a `Queue`. Then in the `Update()` method, when a new target is required, we just deactivate the first object in the queue, adjust its properties, and set it back to active. When the `Queue` is empty, we start creating new objects from the beginning, effectively creating an \"infinite\" spawn pool. This way, the game doesn't have to constantly instantiate new objects, reducing the execution time of `Instantiate()`.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Sure, you can use an object pool to avoid having to constantly instantiate new objects. The object pool is a pre-allocated set of objects that are stored ready to use. You can create a pool in the Start() method of your script and then whenever you need to spawn a new target, check the pool first to see if there's a non-active object available. If there is, you can reset the object and use it; if there isn't, you'll need to instantiate a new one.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use an object pool:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Targets : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject target;\n    public String level; // Integer representing the difficulty level\n    public float spawnInterval = 3f; // Seconds between spawns\n    public int maxTargets = 10; // Max targets allowed in scene\n\n    private float spawnTimer = 0f;\n    private float spawnRange = 5f; // Range for spawning\n    private GameObject[] targetPool; // Object pool for targets\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        level = PlayerPrefs.GetString(\"level\"); // Default to level 1 (\"easy\")\n\n        // Create the object pool\n        targetPool = new GameObject[maxTargets];\n        for(int i = 0; i < maxTargets; i++)\n        {\n            targetPool[i] = Instantiate(target, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity); // Pre-allocated all objects\n            targetPool[i].SetActive(false); // Set them all inactive initially\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        spawnTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n\n        if (spawnTimer >= spawnInterval && GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Target\").Length < maxTargets)\n        {\n            SpawnTarget();\n            spawnTimer = 0f; // Reset the timer\n        }\n    }\n\n    void SpawnTarget()\n    {\n        // Find an inactive object in the pool to use\n        for(int i = 0; i < maxTargets; i++)\n        {\n            if (!targetPool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                // Reset object and set active\n                targetPool[i].SetActive(true);\n\n                // Set position, tag, and level\n                targetPool[i].transform.position = new Vector3(\n                    UnityEngine.Random.Range(-spawnRange, spawnRange),\n                    UnityEngine.Random.Range(1f, 5f),\n                    0);\n\n                targetPool[i].tag = \"Target\";\n                targetPool[i].GetComponent<Targets_movements>().level = level;\n\n                // Exit loop as soon as we find an inactive, ready to use object\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a pool of target objects in the Start() method. When `SpawnTarget()` is called, it checks the pool to find an inactive object. If an inactive object is found, it is reset and activated at the spawn position, tagged as a target, and the level is set. If no inactive objects are found, a new target object is instantiated and added to the pool."
