    "code_repairing_1": "Your previous code was using `Update()` function which is called in every frame, this might lead to problems if your game is running on a high refresh rate monitor. For example, if you were adding a velocity in `Update()`, you would see this velocity being added to your player even faster than you press the key, because `Update()` function is being called faster than the physics engine.\n\nThe physics should be calculated under `FixedUpdate()`. The main difference between `Update()` and `FixedUpdate()` is that `FixedUpdate()` is called on a fixed time interval and it's not affected by your game's frame rate. Therefore, it's better to use `FixedUpdate()` for physics related operations because its smoothness is guaranteed.\n\nAlso, the code you posted in your question has a lot of repeated lines which doesn't make sense because some of them are commented out. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour \n{\n    private Rigidbody playerRigidbody; // \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub9ac\uc9c0\ub4dc\ubc14\ub514 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\n    public float speed = 8f; // \uc774\ub3d9 \uc18d\ub825\n\n    void Start () \n    {\n        playerRigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n    }\n\n    void FixedUpdate () \n    {\n        // Read the player input\n        float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n        float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n        // Create a new Vector3 with the inputs and the speed\n        Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xInput * speed, 0f, zInput * speed);\n\n        // Apply the new velocity\n        playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;\n    }\n}\n```\nAbove code will provide smooth movement when keys are pressed, but will not provide acceleration in between frames which could be undesirable. If you want acceleration, you can integrate the velocity change into FixedUpdate(), but you will need to take care of the framerate-independence on your own.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here is a fixed version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour {\n    private Rigidbody playerRigidbody; // Rigidbody component for movement\n    public float speed = 8f; // Speed of movement\n\n    void Start() {\n        playerRigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n    }\n\n    void FixedUpdate() { // FixedUpdate is called at a fixed interval\n        float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n        float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n        float xSpeed = xInput * speed;\n        float zSpeed = zInput * speed;\n\n        Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xSpeed, 0f, zSpeed);\n\n        playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;  // Set the player's velocity to the new velocity\n    }\n}\n```\nThis script will make the player move forward when the \"Vertical\" input is positive, move backward when negative, and move sideways when \"Horizontal\" input is positive or negative. Make sure to attach this script to your player object and ensure the player object has a Rigidbody component attached. Note that FixedUpdate is better for physics calculations as it matches the fixed frame rate.",
    "code_repairing_3": "```\n    void FixedUpdate() {\n        float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n        float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n        Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xInput, 0f, zInput);\n\n        playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity * speed;\n    }\n```\n\nThe `FixedUpdate()` method is called at a fixed interval and is independent of the frame rate. This is used for physics calculations, such as moving rigidbodies. In your case, we get the input from the horizontal and vertical axes, create a new velocity vector, and then apply this to the player's rigidbody. The speed variable multiplies the velocity, ensuring consistent speed across different frame rates.",
    "code_repairing_4": "void FixedUpdate() {\n    float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n    float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n    float xSpeed = xInput * speed;\n    float zSpeed = zInput * speed;\n\n    Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xSpeed, 0f, zSpeed);\n    playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;  \n}\n    \nYou may want to use FixedUpdate() instead of Update() for physics related operations. This is because FixedUpdate() is called at a fixed interval relative to the time settings. Since it is independent of the frame rate, it is best for physics updates."
