The fixed code now correctly sets the player's velocity to move in a direction based on the player's input.",

The player's speed is applied in the direction of the input axes.",

FixedUpdate runs at a fixed interval, set in the time settings, which is best suited for physics-based movements.\n\nPlease pay attention to the Vector3(xInput, 0f, zInput) and the AddForce part. These lines are responsible for the direction and speed of the player's movement. The (0f, 0f, speed) vector here means the player is moving upwards at a constant speed (defined by 'speed' variable). Likewise, the (-speed, 0f, 0f) vector would move the player to the left at the same speed. Adjust as needed to suit your game's mechanics. \n\nFinally, it's important to note that while speed variable controls the magnitude of movement, the player can still move faster than the specified speed if the user hits the keys multiple times per frame. If you want to limit the speed, you can add a normalization at the end of the code.",
