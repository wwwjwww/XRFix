However, in the OnDestroy method, where the context should not be accessed during the execution of the method until it is guaranteed that no other thread will be accessing it concurrently, the lock statement is necessary to prevent a deadlock. \n\nFurthermore, you don't need to reset the context to 0 after you destroy it, because the destruction was successful. \n\nSo, the fixed code is exactly what you posted.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The issue you are facing is related to the Lock statement. 'this' object is locked as it is being used in an asynchronous call which may interfere with the Unity main thread. The Unity main thread is responsible for updating the scene, rendering, event system, etc. It's important to make sure that all Unity API calls are made on this thread to avoid unexpected behavior.\n\nHowever, the OVRLipSync.DestroyContext function is an asynchronous operation so it may call back on another thread after it's done. This can potentially lead to race conditions if you are also doing work on the main thread after calling OVRLipSync.DestroyContext.\n\nThis could be fixed by running the OVRLipSync.DestroyContext in a coroutine that waits for the Unity API calls to finish. Here is an example:\n\n```csharp\nIEnumerator DestroyContextCoroutine()\n{\n    if (context != 0)\n    {\n        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame(); // Wait until this frame finishes\n        if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" + \" Phoneme context.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    StartCoroutine(DestroyContextCoroutine());\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're ensuring that the Unity API calls are finished before destroying the context. However, this does not guarantee that all Unity API calls are finished. If there are further Unity API calls made after the OVRLipSync.DestroyContext, you will need to manage those to ensure correct execution order.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here is the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    if (context != 0)\n    {\n        OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe issue with your previous code was that the 'this' object was being locked in a lock statement. This is unnecessary and could cause issues if other parts of your code were also trying to access the 'this' object, because they would also need to acquire the same lock.\n\nThe new code removes the lock statement, which should prevent any potential issues. The lock statement was included in the previous code as a placeholder, and is unnecessary in this context.\n\nAlso, ensure that the context is being correctly cleaned up when the GameObject is destroyed (using OnDestroy() method). If the context was successfully created but not destroyed, this could lead to a resource leak.",
    "code_repairing_3": "void OnDestroy()\n{\n    if (context != 0)\n    {\n        if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                \" Phoneme context.\");\n        }\n        context = 0;  // This line sets the context to zero to avoid confusion and incorrect usage.\n    }\n}",
    "code_repairing_4": "```csharp\n    void OnDestroy()\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\nIn your code, you were locking the `this` object in a `lock` statement, which is not a good practice. Usually, you should avoid locking the same objects that you're accessing. If the objects you're locking can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time, you should lock them at a higher level and delegate the lock to the methods that might access them. In this case, it seems that the `OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context)` might be accessed by multiple threads, so I suggest locking the threads accessing it.\n\nAnother important point is that the `OnDestroy` method is called when the GameObject is about to be destroyed, right before it is destroyed. So you should avoid using it for crucial operations such as context destruction. Instead, you can use the `OnDisable` method, which is called when the behaviour is disabled either through the editor or through script."
