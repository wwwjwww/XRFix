    "code_repairing_0": "It looks like you're trying to create a context for OVRLipSync and destroy it when the MonoBehaviour is destroying. However, you didn't include your `OnDestroy` function and the context might be not properly destroyed due to potential errors in the `OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context)` function.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use the `OnDestroy` function:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember, it's a good practice to always handle errors when working with external libraries like OVRLipSync. In the case of `OVRLipSync.DestroyContext()`, it's possible that the context might not be properly destroyed if there's an error with the library.\n\nAlso, be sure to verify the documentation of the OVRLipSync library because you might have unresolved or unimplemented features in this script.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The provided code seems to be incomplete and improperly formatted.

    "code_repairing_2": "```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nYou have added the `OnDestroy` method to clean up the context when the game object is destroyed. However, you didn't actually call `Start()` method to begin the processing. Also, your code is not getting a reference to `audioSource` which is null.\n\nPlease note that to make your Unity project work, you also need the `OVRLipSync` library or the class `OVRLipSync` should be defined in your project. Without this, the code would not work.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The provided Unity C# code is creating an object that uses OVRLipSync to process audio data from an AudioSource. The `OVRLipSync.ContextProviders.Enhanced` option is used for creating the context, and `enableAcceleration` is a boolean value indicating whether to use DSP offload on supported Android devices. \n\nHowever, there seems to be some missing code, specifically the `OnDestroy` method which is usually used to clean up resources when the script is destroyed. The method calls `OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context)` to destroy the context when the game object is destroyed, which is a good practice to free up resources.\n\nIn addition, there is a property `Smoothing` which sets the viseme smoothing level, and it also gets the current smoothing level. It sends a signal to OVRLipSync to change the smoothing parameter and checks if the operation is successful, and logs an error if it fails.\n\nLastly, the `Context` property is used to get the current context ID. \n\nThe provided code does not seem to be a complete script nor is it incomplete. If you have more questions or need further assistance, please provide more context or clarify your needs.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It appears you are trying to use the OVRLipSync class, but you didn't provide the definition or implementation of `OVRLipSync` class. This class is likely part of the Oculus SDK and is used for lip-syncing, i.e., synchronizing lip movements to audio. Without it, the entire code you've shown is not going to work and I can't provide a full solution. \n\nI'll assume it has the methods `CreateContext`, `DestroyContext`, `SendSignal`, and `Result`. Replace `// FIXED CODE:` with the actual code to make the `OnDestroy` method work as intended.\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnDestroy()\n{\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context != 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.DestroyContext(context) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.OnDestroy ERROR: Could not delete\" +\n                    \" Phoneme context.\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code attempts to destroy the context when the GameObject is being destroyed to avoid memory leaks. The context is only destroyed if it was successfully created. In case of an error, an error message is logged. Please note that the DestroyContext function must be called from the main (UI) thread, otherwise Unity may crash. Usually, this is handled by the Unity Engine itself when scripts are using Unity's API (like in coroutines or event callbacks).\n\nRemember to replace `0` with the actual value you used for `context` initialization in `Awake`."
