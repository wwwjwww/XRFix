This ensures that the 'result' field is only accessed by one thread at a time, avoiding the potential race condition that could occur if multiple threads tried to access the same field simultaneously.",
    "code_repairing_1": "To fix the issue with locking the 'this' object, you can use a private readonly object to lock the computation instead. Here's the fixed code:\n\nprivate readonly object lockObject = new object();\n\npublic bool TryGetAnswer(out T answer)\n    {\n        lock (lockObject)\n        {\n            if (got_answer)\n            {\n                answer = result;\n                return true;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                answer = default(T);\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nBy using a private readonly object to lock, we ensure that the lock is not held by any other code, and therefore the locking is safe.",
