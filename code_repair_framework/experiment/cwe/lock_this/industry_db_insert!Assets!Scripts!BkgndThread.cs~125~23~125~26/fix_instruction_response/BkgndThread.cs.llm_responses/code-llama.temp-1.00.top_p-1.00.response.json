    "code_repairing_0": "Sorry, it looks like you're trying to fix a bug in the code. It seems like the code contains a lock statement that locks the 'this' object. However, this is considered a bad practice because the 'this' object might be locked elsewhere.\n\nTo fix the issue, you can replace the lock statement in the 'TryGetAnswer' method with a private readonly object, which is used exclusively for locking. Here's the fixed code:\n```\n// Create a private readonly Object which is used exclusively for locking.\nprivate readonly object _resultLock = new object();\n\n// In the 'TryGetAnswer' method:\nif (got_answer)\n{\n    // Lock the private readonly object using '_resultLock'.\n    lock (_resultLock)\n        answer = result;\n    return true;\n}\nelse\n{\n    answer = default;\n    return false;\n}\n```\nBy using a private readonly object for locking, you ensure that the lock is not used elsewhere and that the code is thread-safe.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The code you provided is a custom-made class named `Compute` that inherits from the `Dispatcher` class. It has two constructors that take delegates as arguments. The `Dispatcher` class is responsible for scheduling work on a background thread, and the `Compute` class simply adds a few additional fields and methods to the `Dispatcher` class.\n\nThe issue you're reporting is with the `TryGetAnswer` method. It contains a lock statement that locks the `this` object, which is considered bad practice. The issue is that the `this` object might be locked elsewhere as well, and locking it in the `TryGetAnswer` method could cause unintended behavior.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can create a private readonly object for locking instead of using the `this` object. The following code shows the updated `TryGetAnswer` method with the private readonly object used for locking:\n```csharp\npublic bool TryGetAnswer(out T answer)\n{\n    if (got_answer)\n    {\n        lock (_lockObject)\n        {\n            answer = result;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        answer = default(T);\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\n// Create a private readonly object for locking\nprivate readonly object _lockObject = new object();\n```\nWith this change, the `Compute` class will use a private readonly object for locking instead of the `this` object, which will help prevent unintended behavior.",
