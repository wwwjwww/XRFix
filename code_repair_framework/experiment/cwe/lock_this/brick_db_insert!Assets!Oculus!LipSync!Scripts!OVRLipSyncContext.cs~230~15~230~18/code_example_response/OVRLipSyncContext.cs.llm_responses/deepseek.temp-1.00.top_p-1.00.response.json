Now the method can be properly synchronized and no other object can interfere with it.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like the bug is in the `ProcessAudioSamplesRaw` function and it's locking on `this` object. This can lead to problems because if your class is inherited by other classes, they might lock on different objects. \n\nA better approach would be to use a protected readonly field to lock on, so that the derived classes still have the ability to lock on their own objects. The original code should be modified as follows:\n\n```csharp\npublic class OVRLipSyncContext : OVRLipSyncContextBase\n{\n    private readonly object mutex = new object();\n\n    // Rest of the code...\n\n    public void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw(float[] data, int channels)\n    {\n        lock (mutex)\n        {\n            if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                return;\n            }\n            var frame = this.Frame;\n            OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n        }\n    }\n    // Rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, even if the derived class locks on a different object, `mutex` will still be used for locking.",
    "code_repairing_2": "'''\n    private readonly Object mutex = new Object();\n\n    public void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw(float[] data, int channels)\n    {\n        lock (mutex)\n        {\n            if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                return;\n            }\n            var frame = this.Frame;\n            OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n        }\n    }\n'''",

    "code_repairing_4": "Here is the corrected version of the code:\n\n```csharp\n// Fixed code:\nprivate readonly Object mutex = new Object();\n\npublic void ProcessAudioSamplesRaw(float[] data, int channels)\n{\n    lock (mutex)\n    {\n        if (Context == 0 || OVRLipSync.IsInitialized() != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n        {\n            return;\n        }\n        var frame = this.Frame;\n        OVRLipSync.ProcessFrame(Context, data, frame, channels == 2);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code replaces the lock statement that was locking the `this` object with a lock statement that locks a separate `mutex` object. This ensures that the buggy code is no longer actively trying to lock the `this` object, which could lead to deadlock situations if the calling code also tries to acquire the lock on `this`. This is just one of the many ways to prevent the buggy code from locking the `this` object, and it doesn't necessarily mean that the buggy code will work correctly in all situations, but it does mean that the buggy code will at least not cause deadlock."
