Always ensure that the lock object is private and not exposed to other classes."

Locking on a publicly accessible object like `this` isn't recommended because it might cause deadlocks or other unexpected synchronization behavior if the object is locked elsewhere in the code. To fix this issue, we need to create a private object to lock on. Here's how you might rewrite the `Awake` method with this fix applied:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n[RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))]\npublic class OVRLipSyncContextBase : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ... (other parts of the class remain unchanged)\n\n    // Create a private readonly object for locking purposes.\n    private readonly object locker = new object();\n\n    void Awake()\n    {\n        if (!audioSource)\n        {\n            audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();\n        }\n\n        lock (locker)\n        {\n            if (context == 0)\n            {\n                if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n                {\n                    Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Start ERROR: Could not create\" +\n                        \" Phoneme context.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the class remains unchanged)\n}\n```\n\nIn this FIXED CODE section, I've added a private `locker` object and used it in the `lock` statement within the `Awake` method. This change will prevent external code from being able to lock on the same object that the `OVRLipSyncContextBase` class locks, thus reducing the potential for deadlock and other threading issues."

To fix this, we should create a private, readonly object to use as a lock instead. \n\nBelow is the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n[RequireComponent(typeof(AudioSource))]\npublic class OVRLipSyncContextBase : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private readonly object lockObject = new object();\n    public AudioSource audioSource = null;\n    // Existing class code unchanged until the fixed Awake method...\n\n    void Awake()\n    {\n        if (!audioSource)\n        {\n            audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();\n        }\n\n        lock (lockObject)\n        {\n            if (context == 0)\n            {\n                if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration)\n                    != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n                {\n                    Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Awake ERROR: Could not create\" +\n                        \" Phoneme context.\");\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // The rest of the class remains unchanged...\n}\n```\n\nWe have removed the section that contained the bug and its message, and added the fixed code at the appropriate place. The private object `lockObject` is now used for locking, preventing external conflicts with other instances/entities that may have locked the `this` reference. The `Awake` function has been updated to use `lockObject` for synchronization."
