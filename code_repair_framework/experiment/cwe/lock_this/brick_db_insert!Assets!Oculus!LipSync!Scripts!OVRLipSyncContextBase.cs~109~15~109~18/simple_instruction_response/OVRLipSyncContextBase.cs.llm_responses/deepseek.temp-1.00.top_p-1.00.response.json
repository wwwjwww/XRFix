    "code_repairing_0": "The code you've provided seems to be missing a closing brace and is missing several blocks, so it's hard to understand what exactly you're asking for. However, based on the information given, I can provide some guidance.\n\nIf you're asking for some missing parts of the code, here's a possible continuation assuming the intention is to initialize the context and start the lip sync.\n\n```csharp\n    //     }\n    // \n    //     void Start()\n    //     {\n    //         if (context == 0)\n    //         {\n    //             if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n    //             {\n    //                 Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Start ERROR: Could not create Phoneme context.\");\n    //                 return;\n    //             }\n    //         }\n    // \n    //         // Assuming you have an AudioClip and you're using this to feed into audioSource\n    //         audioSource.clip = yourAudioClipHere;\n    //         audioSource.Play();\n    // \n    //         StartCoroutine(ProcessLipSync());\n    //     }\n    // \n    //     IEnumerator ProcessLipSync()\n    //     {\n    //         while (audioSource.isPlaying)\n    //         {\n    //             if (OVRLipSync.GetFrame(context, ref frame) == OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n    //             {\n    //                 // You can then process the frame using the information inside\n    //             }\n    // \n    //             yield return null;\n    //         }\n    //     }\n    // }\n```\n\nThis is assuming that `OVRLipSync.GetFrame` returns an error when called before the context is set up, which might be the case based on documentation. If that's the case, you'll need to make sure you're setting up the context before you start processing audio data. \n\nPlease provide more specific details if you're having trouble with a particular part of your code.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The provided code seems to be a part of a Unity script for the Oculus Voice SDK. It is a base class for various lip sync contexts, which use OVRLipSync. This class requires the AudioSource component to be present on the same GameObject. The class also sets up and controls the OVRLipSync context and provides methods for setting and getting the lip sync context and viseme smoothing parameters.\n\nHowever, it seems like you have omitted some important part of the code due to formatting issues. As it stands, the script lacks both the `Awake()` function where the OVRLipSync context is created, and some vital methods such as `Start()`, `Update()`, or `FixedUpdate()`. \n\nPlease make sure to include these crucial pieces in your code, which will control the execution of the OVRLipSync algorithm based on the audio source. \n\nRemember to call the `OVRLipSync.CreateContext` method in the `Awake()` function to setup the context, and set up any required parameters (like `provider`, `enableAcceleration`). Also, ensure to check the OVRLipSync.Result for any errors that may occur during this process.\n\nAlso, make sure that OVRLipSync SDK is correctly integrated in your Unity project and the OVRLipSync.ContextProvider is properly setup.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The code you've provided is incomplete and doesn't compile because of the missing `OnDestroy` method and the initialization of the `context` variable inside the `Awake` method. But let's address only the issue with the `Awake` method. \n\nThe `Awake` method you've provided creates an OVRLipSync context if it hasn't been created yet. If the creation fails, it logs an error message. However, it seems like there's something wrong because you never call the `Start()` method or invoke `Update()` which would likely be used to get the audio input and process it.\n\nIn Unity, the `Awake` method is called when the object is created and the object is placed in the scene. The `Start` method on the other hand is called right after `Awake`. Both `Awake` and `Start` methods are often used to initialize variables, create instances of objects, or trigger animation sequences. \n\nHere's an example of how you might complete your `Awake` method:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Awake()\n{\n    if (!audioSource)\n    {\n        audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();\n    }\n\n    lock (this)\n    {\n        if (context == 0)\n        {\n            if (OVRLipSync.CreateContext(ref context, provider, 0, enableAcceleration) != OVRLipSync.Result.Success)\n            {\n                Debug.LogError(\"OVRLipSyncContextBase.Start ERROR: Could not create Phoneme context.\");\n                return;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Start the audio source\n    audioSource.Play();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, I've added the line `audioSource.Play();` which starts the audio source that is part of this GameObject. \n\nRemember to replace placeholders and adapt your code to fit your specific project needs.",
