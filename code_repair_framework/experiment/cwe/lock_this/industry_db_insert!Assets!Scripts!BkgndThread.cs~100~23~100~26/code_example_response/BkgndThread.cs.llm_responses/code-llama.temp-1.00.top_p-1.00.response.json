The `Compute<T>` class has a `result` variable of type `T`, a `got_answer` variable of type `bool`, and a `result1` variable of type `T` that is used to store the result of the `run_delegate` function. The `Compute<T>` constructor schedules a thread to run the `run_delegate` function and sets the `result1` variable to the result of the function, then locks the `this` object and sets the `result` variable to `result1` and sets the `got_answer` variable to `true`.\n\nThis fix ensures that the `result` and `got_answer` variables are correctly synchronized between threads, and avoids the potential race condition between the `lock (this)` statement and the `result` and `got_answer` variables."
