    "code_repairing_1": "It appears you've posted a C# code snippet related to creating an OVRBoundary class. This code defines a class that provides several methods for working with boundaries in a virtual reality application.\n\nThis particular code is using Unity's Oculus SDK for VR interaction. It defines an enum for different types of nodes that can be tested for boundary detection, defines another enum for the types of boundaries.\n\nThe code also defines a structure representing the result of a boundary test. Finally, it includes methods for:\n  1. Checking if the Oculus XR device is already loaded and it's Oculus.\n  2. Testing a specific node against a boundary type.\n  3. Testing a specific point against a boundary type.\n\nIt also seems to have some buffer management for storing geometry data. Please ensure you have the proper setup for the Oculus SDK and the Unity Project to use this code.\n\nRemember that any project using Unity and Oculus SDK would require an Android build support, since the Oculus SDK does not support the development in standalone PC mode.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code appears to be C# using Unity's XR Management and SDK for Oculus (OVRPlugin). \n\nThe code defines a couple of enumerations for different types of nodes and boundary types. Then it defines a struct for holding results from boundary tests. The class `OVRBoundary` has methods for getting configured boundaries, testing a specified node or a point against a boundary, and caching native buffer data related to geometry.\n\nThe `TestNode` and `TestPoint` methods handle boundary tests. They take a `Node` or `Point` and a `BoundaryType` as input, and return a `BoundaryTestResult`. The test results include whether the boundary is being triggered, the closest distance from the node or point to the boundary, and the closest point on the boundary and its normal vector.\n\nAdditionally, it seems like there are some extra methods for handling native buffer data related to geometry. This is a common mechanism for passing data between .NET and native code, and it's likely used for geometry related to the boundaries.\n\nThe code also contains some references to the `OVRManager.XRDevice.Oculus`, meaning it only works with the Oculus XR device. Make sure to have the corresponding XR plugins (like Oculus XR Plugin for Unity) installed and loaded when this script runs.\n\nYou may want to ensure the correct OVRPlugin API is being referenced in this code, as the method names and structures used may not be present in your OVRPlugin version.",

    "code_repairing_4": "The given code appears to be written in C# and is for a Unity game engine, specifically for creating an Oculus Quest compatible boundary system. The code includes a few classes and enums that define the node types for boundary testing, the type of boundaries, and the result of a boundary test. The boundary tests can be performed on either a node or a point in 3D space.\n\nThe main class, `OVRBoundary`, has properties to test the configured boundary, and methods to test both nodes and points against boundaries. These tests return a structure with data about the result of the test, including if the node/point is triggering the boundary, the distance to the closest point of the boundary, the closest point itself, and the normal of that point.\n\nThe code also deals with some interaction with the OVRPlugin, which is likely Unity's interface to the Oculus plugin. If the Oculus SDK is not being used or is not being used correctly, it will either fail or provide incorrect results.\n\nIt's important to note that without being connected to a specific project or having the actual context, I can't say for certain that everything is functioning correctly. Nevertheless, this code seems to be written cleanly and according to best practices."
