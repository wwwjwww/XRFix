    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you're trying to create a class in C# called 'EnumCodeWrapper'. Your code snippet is incomplete, so I am unable to fully understand your intention. However, based on your code snippet it appears you are using the C# CodeDom library to generate and compile C# code.\n\nIf you're trying to create an enumeration in C#, the process might not be with the EnumCodeWrapper, but with a CodeTypeReference of CodeTypeReferenceKind.Enum. Here's an example on how to define an enumeration:\n\n```csharp\nCodeTypeDeclaration enumType = new CodeTypeDeclaration(\"MyEnum\");\nenumType.TypeAttributes = TypeAttributes.Public | TypeAttributes.Sealed;\nenumType.IsEnum = true;\nenumType.CustomAttributes.Add(new CodeAttributeDeclaration(new CodeTypeReference(\"Flags\")));\n\n_typeDeclaration.Members.Add(enumType);\n```\n\nIt defines an enumeration named 'MyEnum' and flags it as a sealed public enum.\n\nHowever, please note that 'CodeDom' is a powerful tool but has a steep learning curve and the generated code can be quite hard to read sometimes.\n\nIf you're using 'CodeDom' to dynamically generate code that represents an `enum`, you might want to consider using something else, like `Enum.ToString()` to generate enum values.\n\nAlso remember to provide more context so I can provide a more precise response.",
