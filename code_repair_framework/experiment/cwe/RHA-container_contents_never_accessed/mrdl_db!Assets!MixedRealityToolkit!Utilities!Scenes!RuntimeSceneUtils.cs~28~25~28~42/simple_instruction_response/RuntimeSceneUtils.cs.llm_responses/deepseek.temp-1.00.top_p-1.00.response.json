    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you're working with Unity and the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), and you're trying to use the `RuntimeSceneUtils` class to get the name of a scene from its path, or to check if a scene exists. However, your code is incomplete, so I'll complete it for you. You should continue with this example:\n\n```csharp\n            // Get all scene paths in the project\n            string[] scenePaths = UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.GetAllAssetPaths();\n            List<Scene> allScenesInProject = new List<Scene>();\n\n            // Convert each path to scene and add to the list\n            for (int i = 0; i < scenePaths.Length; i++)\n            {\n                allScenesInProject.Add(UnityEditor.EditorBuildSettings.scenes[i]);\n            }\n\n            // Iterate over all scenes to find a match\n            for (int i = 0; i < allScenesInProject.Count; i++)\n            {\n                string scenePath = allScenesInProject[i].path;\n                string sceneName = System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(scenePath);\n\n                if (sceneName == sceneName)\n                {\n                    scene = allScenesInProject[i];\n                    sceneIndex = i;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return false;  // No matching scene found\n```\n\nThe `FindScene` function returns a boolean indicating whether a scene with the given name was found. If so, `scene` and `sceneIndex` are set to the corresponding Scene and index in the project's all scenes list.\n\nPlease note that this code should be used within the Unity Editor, as it relies on functionality that Unity's scripting API doesn't expose (`UnityEditor.AssetDatabase.GetAllAssetPaths()`, `UnityEditor.EditorBuildSettings.scenes`).",
    "code_repairing_1": "List<Scene> allScenesInProject = new List<Scene>(SceneManager.GetAllScenes());\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < allScenesInProject.Count; i++)\n            {\n                if (string.Equals(allScenesInProject[i].name, sceneName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\n                {\n                    scene = allScenesInProject[i];\n                    sceneIndex = i;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis code block is used to find a scene by name in the Unity project. It accepts a string parameter sceneName representing the name of the scene you want to find. It checks each scene in the project to see if its name matches the provided name. If it finds a match, it returns true, the scene, and its index. If it doesn't find a match, it returns false, and defaults for scene and sceneIndex.\n\nThe code block uses the SceneManager class to get all the scenes in the project and stores them in an IEnumerable collection. The \"foreach\" loop iterates over each scene in the collection, comparing its name to the provided sceneName. If a match is found, the function returns true, assigns the matched scene to the \"scene\" output parameter, assigns the index of the matched scene to the \"sceneIndex\" output parameter, and exits the function. If no match is found after checking all scenes, the function returns false and the default values for scene and sceneIndex.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you are trying to complete the `FindScene` method. In Unity, you can use the `SceneManager.sceneCount` property to get the number of scenes in the project and `SceneManager.GetSceneAt(int index).name` to get the name of a scene at a particular index. Here is how you can modify the function to find a scene by name:\n\n```csharp\npublic static bool FindScene(string sceneName, out Scene scene, out int sceneIndex)\n{\n    scene = default(Scene);\n    sceneIndex = -1;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCount; i++)\n    {\n        if(SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i).name == sceneName)\n        {\n            scene = SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i);\n            sceneIndex = i;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each scene in the project and compare its name with the one provided by the `sceneName` parameter. If it finds a match, it sets the `scene` and `sceneIndex` out parameters to the respective scene and its index, and returns true. If it doesn't find any matches, it returns false.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like you have an incomplete block of code here. However, I'll try to piece it together.\n\nIf you want to find a scene by its name within the Unity project, you can use SceneManager.GetSceneByName(string sceneName). This method will return a Scene object if the scene with the specified name exists, or an empty Scene object if not. \n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```csharp\npublic static bool FindScene(string sceneName, out Scene scene, out int sceneIndex)\n{\n    scene = default(Scene);\n    sceneIndex = -1;\n\n    // Try to find the scene by name\n    Scene foundScene = SceneManager.GetSceneByName(sceneName);\n\n    if (foundScene.IsValid())\n    {\n        scene = foundScene;\n        sceneIndex = foundScene.buildIndex;\n        return true;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Debug.LogWarning(\"Scene with name: \" + sceneName + \" not found.\");\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the GetSceneByName method is used to attempt to find a scene with the given name. If the scene is found (i.e. the method does not return an empty Scene object), the scene and its build index are stored in the 'scene' and 'sceneIndex' parameters, respectively. The method returns true if the scene was found. If the scene was not found, it logs a warning and returns false.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you are missing the code to find a scene in the build settings. Here's the completed code:\n\n```csharp\n            for (int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCountInBuildSettings; i++)\n            {\n                string scenePath = SceneUtility.GetScenePathByBuildIndex(i);\n                string sceneNameInFile = GetSceneNameFromScenePath(scenePath);\n\n                if (sceneNameInFile == sceneName)\n                {\n                    scene = SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i);\n                    sceneIndex = i;\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            return false;\n        }\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all the scenes in the build settings and returns the scene if it matches the given scene name. It also returns the index of the scene in the build settings. If no matching scene is found, it returns false."
