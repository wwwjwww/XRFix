The main issue was that the for loop in the `FindScene` method was not using the correct syntax. In C#, you cannot use a `=` operator to assign a value to a variable in a `for` loop. Instead, you need to use the `:` operator, like so:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCount; i++)\n\nAdditionally, the `GetSceneNameFromScenePath` method was also not using the correct syntax. The `GetFileNameWithoutExtension` method takes a string as its parameter, and returns the file name without the file extension. In the original code, the `scenePath` variable was not being passed as a parameter to the method.\n\nSo, the fixed code adds the necessary changes to the `FindScene` method to make it work correctly, and also calls the `GetSceneNameFromScenePath` method correctly to get the scene name from the scene path.",

The fix is to iterate through the scenes in the `SceneManager` and check if the `name` property of each scene matches the `sceneName` parameter. If it does, then we set the `scene` and `sceneIndex` output parameters to the corresponding scene and index, and return `true`. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a matching scene, we return `false` instead.\n\nThe `GetSceneNameFromScenePath` method is still present in the fixed code, but it is not used in the `FindScene` method. Therefore, it can be removed.",
