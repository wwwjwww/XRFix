    "code_repairing_0": "It appears you've gone a bit off-topic in your question. However, based on the provided code, it appears you're implementing a feature for loading a pre-defined number of rooms (40 in this case) from a specific \"saves\" directory. \n\nThis code uses the `FindSaves` function to retrieve an array of .bricks files. If there are no rooms in the saves directory, the `RenderNoSavedRooms` function is called. If there are rooms, the `RenderSavedRoomsList` function is called which initializes the list and enables the saved rooms object.\n\nHowever, without more context about what the code is meant to do, it's a bit hard to provide a more specific answer. Do you have any questions about this code or some specific functionality you're trying to implement?",
