    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you've pasted your code without asking a question. It seems like you're trying to use classes from the Mixed Reality Toolkit in Unity. However, you didn't provide any context or the task you're trying to achieve. For instance, you mentioned a list of touching sources and some methods, but didn't elaborate on where or how you want to use them. \n\nIf you want to use the classes or create new ones, I can help you. Could you please provide more details about what you're trying to achieve?",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you are having trouble with your code. However, it's not complete and not clear what exactly do you need help with. \n\nFrom the namespaces you are using, it seems like you are using the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for Unity, which is a framework for building mixed reality applications. The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger script. \n\nCould you please provide more details about what exactly you need to do with the provided code? For example, \"using Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Input;\" is related to Mixed Reality Toolkit's input system, so you might need help with a specific functionality related to this system.\n\nAlso, please note that this is C# code, so make sure it is running in a context where the Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit and UnityEngine namespaces are available.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code is incomplete but I assume you're trying to set up a list to store IMixedRealityInputSource objects. Here's a basic example:\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Input;\nusing Microsoft.MixedReality.Toolkit.Utilities;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class YourClassName : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private readonly List<IMixedRealityInputSource> touchingSources = new List<IMixedRealityInputSource>();\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a list `touchingSources` where you can store and manipulate `IMixedRealityInputSource` objects. Note that you'll need to implement the actual functionality you need based on the context where this code is used.\n\nAlso, please make sure to replace `YourClassName` with the actual name of your class.\n\nIf you have more specific question or problem with your code, please provide more details so I may provide a more accurate solution.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It appears you are having a code snippet here but it's not complete. I can help with a specific part of your code if you provide more information. Are you experiencing any errors or need help with a specific section of code?",
