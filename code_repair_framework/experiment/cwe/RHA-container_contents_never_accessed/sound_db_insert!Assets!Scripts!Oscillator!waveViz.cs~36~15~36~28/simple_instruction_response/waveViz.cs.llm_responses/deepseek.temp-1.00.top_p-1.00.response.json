    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you're trying to create a wave visualization for sound in Unity. However, you didn't ask any specific question. Could you please provide more information about what specific functionality you want to add or what problem you're encountering?\n\nFrom the code you've posted, it seems to be mostly correct, assuming you have the required functions `ProcessWaveTexture` in your 'SoundStageNative' library.\n\nThis code may have a few issues:\n- The method `ProcessWaveTexture` does not seem to be static, so it cannot be called directly from a static context. You might need to call it from an instance of `waveViz`.\n- The color arguments in the function call might be incorrect since they are not clearly defined in the method call.\n- It's not clear what the `buffer` and `length` parameters represent. It might be necessary to have more context to understand their usage.\n- `waveBG` is used to initialize the `wavepixels` array before the `ProcessWaveTexture` function is called. If the function does not have any side effects on this variable, ensure it's set before this function is called.\n- The function `ProcessWaveTexture` might be modifying the `lastWaveH` and `curWaveW` variables by reference. Make sure to correctly capture these variables when making the function call.\n  \nSorry, but without more context, it's hard to provide a more accurate solution.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you're trying to use an external DLL function from your Unity script. The function you're trying to use is `ProcessWaveTexture`. \n\nThis function is expected to take an array of floating point numbers (`float[] buffer`), an integer (`int length`) for the length of the `buffer`, a pointer to a `System.IntPtr` (`System.IntPtr pixels`), and several bytes for RGB color values (`byte Ra, byte Ga, byte Ba, byte Rb, byte Gb, byte Bb`).\n\n`waveheight`, `wavewidth`, and `period` are integers as well. You also have `lastWaveH` and `curWaveW` as integer references.\n\nHowever, your Unity script is incomplete and doesn't seem to contain any methods that call or interact with this `ProcessWaveTexture` function. \n\nWithout the full context of your script, I can't provide a complete solution. But here's a general idea on how you might call this function:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    float[] buffer = new float[wavewidth]; \n    // initialize buffer with your data...\n\n    byte Ra = 0, Ga = 0, Ba = 0, Rb = 0, Gb = 0, Bb = 0;\n    // initialize RGB color values...\n\n    System.IntPtr pixels = Marshal.AllocHGlobal(wavewidth * waveheight * 4);\n    ProcessWaveTexture(buffer, wavewidth, pixels, Ra, Ga, Ba, Rb, Gb, Bb, period, waveheight, wavewidth, ref lastWaveH, ref curWaveW);\n\n    Color32[] wavepixels = new Color32[wavewidth * waveheight];\n    Marshal.Copy(pixels, wavepixels, 0, wavewidth * waveheight);\n    Marshal.FreeHGlobal(pixels);\n\n    tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);\n    tex.Apply();\n}\n```\n\nThis code initializes a buffer with dummy data and RGB color values. It then calls `ProcessWaveTexture`. The pixel data it receives is copied to a managed array using `Marshal.Copy` and then applied to a texture. \n\nRemember to replace the dummy data and color values with your own data. Be sure to free the allocated memory when you're done with it.",
