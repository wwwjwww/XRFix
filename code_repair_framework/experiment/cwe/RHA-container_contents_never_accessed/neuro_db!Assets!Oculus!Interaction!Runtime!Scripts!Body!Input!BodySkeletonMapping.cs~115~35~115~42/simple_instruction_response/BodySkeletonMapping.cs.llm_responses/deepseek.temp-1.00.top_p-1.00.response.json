    "code_repairing_0": "Sure, I can help you finish the code for the Node class. Here it is:\n\n```csharp\n                public Node(TSourceJointId sourceJointId, BodyJointId bodyJointId)\n                {\n                    this.SourceJointId = sourceJointId;\n                    this.BodyJointId = bodyJointId;\n                }\n\n                public List<Node> Children { get; } = new List<Node>();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `SourceJointId` is the source joint identifier (which is `TSourceJointId` type) and `BodyJointId` is the body joint identifier (which is `BodyJointId` type). `Parent` is a reference to the parent node, and `Children` is a list of child nodes. The constructor `Node(TSourceJointId sourceJointId, BodyJointId bodyJointId)` initializes the source joint and body joint identifiers.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you're trying to finish your code but I can't quite see where you're going since you've ended the class `Node` with no following code. Also, your `SkeletonTree` class seems incomplete, particularly the `List<Node> Children` is missing. If you mean to create a list of children for the Node class you can do so as follows:\n\n```C#\npublic class Node\n{\n    public readonly TSourceJointId SourceJointId;\n    public readonly BodyJointId BodyJointId;\n\n    public Node Parent;\n    public List<Node> Children = new List<Node>();\n\n    public Node(TSourceJointId sourceJointId, BodyJointId bodyJointId)\n    {\n        SourceJointId = sourceJointId;\n        BodyJointId = bodyJointId; \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e! \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0430",
    "code_repairing_2": "It appears you have not provided the correct end of your code. It appears you are currently having a problem with the `SkeletonTree` class. If you can provide the rest of your code, I would be able to help you better.\n\nHowever, based on the given code, it appears that you have a `SkeletonTree` class that represents a skeleton tree, with a root node and a node list. The `Nodes` property stores a dictionary of BodyJointId and Source Joint Id mapping. The `Root` property stores the root node of the skeleton tree.\n\nThe `Node` class has a constructor that takes a `SourceJointId` and a `BodyJointId`, a parent node, and a list of children nodes. The parent and children are not initialized because they are not explicitly mentioned in the code.\n\nHowever, it appears that there is a problem with the code: the `Parent` property of a `Node` is not initialized because you're adding children to it, but it hasn't been set beforehand. You could add a null check when trying to add children to a parent to ensure that the parent exists in the node mapping, thus preventing null reference errors.\n\nYou also need to implement the `GetRoot()` method and `GetJointMapping()` method, which are not implemented in the provided code. The `GetRoot()` method should return the root source joint id, and `GetJointMapping()` should return a dictionary that describes the relationship between source and body joints. The dictionary should have keys of type `TSourceJointId` and values of type `JointInfo`. The `JointInfo` class is another abstract class that requires implementation and has properties like Body Joint Id and Parent Joint Id.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Looks like you're programming in C# and Unity and using Oculus Interaction library. It seems you've got a BodySkeletonMapping class which implements ISkeletonMapping. The class includes methods for mapping between different body joints or skeleton parts. \n\nIt seems incomplete or there's a lot of code not shown. If you have a specific question or problem related to this class, please provide more context or a specific question so I can assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_4": "You seemed to be missing the closing brackets at the end of the code. Can you please provide the complete code with the missing closing brackets? This can help me understand and provide a more accurate response to your problem."
