    "code_repairing_0": "The given code appears to be a Unity script that is using the OVRLipSync library to process and analyze audio data. It includes features for keyboard and touch-based control, loopback of audio, and the display of viseme scores. The code includes methods for preprocessing audio samples, postprocessing audio samples, and handling keyboard input.\n\nHowever, the `ProcessAudioSamplesRaw` method is incomplete and commented out. This could mean that it was unfinished or removed in the provided code snippet. If the full code of this method is available, it would resolve this matter.\n\nAlso, the part where the code is showing visemes and laughter scores in the `DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter` method is missing. Assuming this method is supposed to format and display these scores on the Unity console, the relevant code would be needed. If it is incomplete or not clear, please provide the missing part so I can help you complete it.\n\nLastly, the line `if (enableTouchInput) OVRTouchpad.AddListener(LocalTouchEventCallback);` seems to be missing the function `LocalTouchEventCallback` definition. This line is adding a listener for touchpad events, but an implementation for `LocalTouchEventCallback` is missing. If it's a custom touchpad input event, you'd need to define this function.\n\nPlease provide the missing part for me to be able to assist you further.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your code seems incomplete and not properly formatted. It seems you are trying to implement OVRLipSyncContext but you are not providing a clear context or the specific part you're having trouble. However, based on your code, it seems you are handling audio processing in Unity with OVRLipSync. When you are pre-processing and post-processing audio samples, you're scaling the audio gain and discarding certain audio samples based on the `audioLoopback` and `skipAudioSource` options. It seems like this is part of an audio processing pipeline you might be working with, so ensure that you have your audio source properly set up and that it's hooked up to your OVRLipSyncContext. If you have any specific issue you're facing, please provide more detail so I can better help you.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like there's a missing part in your code. You didn't provide it, but I noticed a missing method in your script. The method you're supposed to implement to handle raw audio samples after processing, is missing. Please provide this missing method.",
    "code_repairing_3": "From your provided code, it seems like it's missing a closing bracket `}` that is missing from your class definition. Furthermore, it seems like you have some unnecessary closing curly braces `}` at the end.
