This is a common practice to ensure that the destroyed state is reflected in the object's state."

This change ensures that the lock is not exposed to external classes and prevents the risk of deadlocks associated with locking on `this`. Additionally, I've added a line to reset the `context` to zero after the `DestroyContext` call, to ensure proper cleanup of the context."

This change eliminates the risk of deadlocks that could occur if other objects attempt to lock on the same instance (`this`) concurrently. As a result, the `OnDestroy` method now safely acquires a lock on `contextLock` when operating on the context to ensure thread safety."

This way, the lock is now using a separate, dedicated object that is not exposed to external access, addressing the concern about locking the `this` object. The rest of the code remains unchanged, so ensure you keep any other logic and methods that were in the original class."
