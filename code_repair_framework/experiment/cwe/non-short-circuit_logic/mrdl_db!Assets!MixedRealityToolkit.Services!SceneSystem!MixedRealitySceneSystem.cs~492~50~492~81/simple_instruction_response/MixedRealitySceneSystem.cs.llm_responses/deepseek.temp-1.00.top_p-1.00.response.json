    "code_repairing_1": "Your code seems to have been cut off and not formatted correctly. However, based on the incomplete information, it appears you are trying to manage scene loading and unloading in a mixed reality application using the Unity Engine. \n\nThis code seems to be trying to manage the loading and unloading of different scenes that are part of the application. It seems to be doing this in response to various actions such as loading or unloading content.\n\nIt appears to be properly managing the scene loading and unloading by using the `SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync` function to load the scenes in the background and `SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync` to unload them. The `AsyncOperation.isDone` property is used to track when the loading and unloading is complete.\n\nHowever, without the context of what you're trying to achieve, it's hard to provide any specific recommendations or optimizations. If you could provide more information about this code and the behavior you're trying to achieve, I could give more specific guidance.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It appears like your question got cut off. The code snippet you provided appears incomplete. However, it seems to be part of a larger C# script related to a scene management system. The class `MixedRealitySceneSystem` in the script has some scene loading and unloading methods, as well as some other methods related to managing lighting scenes. If you have a specific question about this code snippet, please provide more details.",
