    "code_repairing_0": "Your code seems to be incomplete and I cannot fully understand what you're trying to achieve without more context. However, I can help you to create an enum named \"BoneId\" and check its maximum value. I'm assuming the \"Hand_End\" enum is also an integer type. Here is an example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic enum Hand_End\n{\n    // define your enum values here\n    // like: Value1 = 1, Value2 = 2, etc.\n    Value1 = 1,\n    Value2 = 2,\n    // continue defining your enum values\n}\n\npublic enum BoneId\n{\n    Max = ((int)Hand_End > (int)Hand_End.Value1) ? (int)Hand_End : (int)Hand_End.Value1,\n}\n```\nIn this code, \"Hand_End\" is an enum that contains integer values. The maximum value in this enum will be used as the maximum value for \"BoneId\". If the maximum value in \"Hand_End\" is greater than 50, the maximum value for \"BoneId\" will be 50. Otherwise, the maximum value for \"BoneId\" will be the maximum value in \"Hand_End\".\n\nPlease replace the defined values in \"Hand_End\" according to your need and modify the 'Value1' and 'Value2' in the code according to your actual enum values in \"Hand_End\".",

    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you're trying to define an enum with fixed values in C#, but you haven't provided the rest of the code. However, I can provide an example of how you could define an enum along with the commented code you've provided:\n\n```csharp\npublic enum BoneId\n{\n    // If Hand_End is greater than 50 and less than int.MaxValue, use Hand_End. Otherwise, use 50.\n    Max = (Hand_End <= int.MaxValue && Hand_End > 50) ? Hand_End : 50,\n\n    // Define other bone IDs here. For example:\n    Hand = 1,\n    Finger = 2\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the code defines an enum `BoneId` with two elements: `Hand` (set to 1) and `Finger` (set to 2). The `Max` element uses a conditional operator to set its value to `Hand_End` if `Hand_End` is less than or equal to `int.MaxValue` and greater than 50. Otherwise, it defaults to 50.\n\nPlease provide the rest of the code if you need further assistance.",
