    "code_repairing_0": "The fixed code should look like this:\n\n'''\n// BUG: Constant condition\n// MESSAGE: A condition that always evaluates to 'true' or always evaluates to 'false' should be removed, and if the condition is a loop condition, the condition is likely to cause an infinite loop.\nMax = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50,\n\n'''\n\nThis change is necessary because the condition `(int)Hand_End > 50` is always true or false, causing an infinite loop. The corrected code simply assigns the result of `Hand_End` as max value.",
    "code_repairing_1": "'''\npublic static int Max = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50;\n'''",
    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, here are the corrections in your code:\n\n1. In the Bad class method, the condition in the return statement was incorrect. It should be comparing 'a' with 'b' and returning the larger value. So, it should be: `return a > b ? a : b;`\n\n2. In the `BoneId` enum, the constant condition issue was corrected. It should check if the value of `Hand_End` is greater than 50, and if so, return `Hand_End`. If `Hand_End` is less or equal to 50, return 50. The corrected code is:\n\n```csharp\nMax = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50,\n```",
    "code_repairing_3": "Removing the constant condition can prevent an infinite loop from occurring if the condition never changes:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic enum BoneId\n{\n\t// The condition is always evaluating to false, not just never reaching the condition.\n    // Therefore we don't change the condition, but remove the whole line:\n    // Max = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50,\n```\n\nIf the condition is only true or false once per condition, then removing the condition can also solve the problem:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic enum BoneId\n{\n\t// If this condition is true once, remove it:\n    // if (Mathf.Abs(a) < Mathf.SmallestNonpositiveFloat) a = 0;\n```",
    "code_repairing_4": "'''\nenum BoneId\n{\n    Max = (((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50),\n'''\n\nFYI, it will be helpful if you can also provide a brief explanation about your buggy code and suggest the changes you've made in order to fix the issue. This will help us provide you with more useful answers."
