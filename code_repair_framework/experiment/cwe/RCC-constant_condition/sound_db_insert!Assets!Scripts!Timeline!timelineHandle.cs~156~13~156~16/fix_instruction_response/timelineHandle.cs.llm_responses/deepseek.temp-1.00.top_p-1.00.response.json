    "code_repairing_0": "The code you've provided seems to be a part of a larger UnityScript codebase.

The condition `curState == state` is always true, thus the return statement, which ends the function execution if the current state equals the new state, is always reached.\n\nConsider removing the condition if it is not needed, or reevaluate the logic of the function.

This condition always evaluates to 'true' or always evaluates to 'false', which can cause an infinite loop in your program.\n\nThe part where there's a condition like `(true) highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", .9f);` is the source of the constant condition. \n\nIn the fixed code, this part has been replaced with `highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", Mathf.Approximately(_timelineEvent.track, 0) ? 0 : 0.9f);`, which checks if `_timelineEvent.track` is approximately 0, if so it sets the emission gain to 0, otherwise it sets it to 0.9f. This ensures that there's no infinite condition loop. \n\nThe other part of the bug was that the highlight was set to active if `multiselected` is true. If `multiselected` is false, the highlight should not be active. The fixed code takes this into account as well.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The code you've provided seems to be incomplete. It would be helpful if you could provide more information about the issue you're facing. However, based on the parts shown, it seems like there might be an issue with an infinite loop or constant condition. I would suggest reviewing the conditions again if you're having trouble with them.\n\nIn the context of constant conditions, if the condition always evaluates to 'true' or 'false', it could potentially lead to infinite loops or other problems. For instance, if you have a loop that runs until a certain condition is met, it could be stuck in an infinite loop if the condition is always true. To avoid this, you could use break statements or other control structures to exit the loop if the condition is found to always be true or false, respectively.\n\nIf this doesn't help, more information about the error you're getting or the exact problem you're encountering would be useful for further troubleshooting.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The code you've provided seems to have a constant true condition that is likely not intended. The condition was causing a warning, suggesting that the condition always evaluates to 'true' or 'false', which could possibly result in an infinite loop.\n\nHere is a corrected version of the code:\n\n```csharp\nif (curState == state) return;\n\nif (curState == manipState.grabbed && state != manipState.grabbed) {\n    _timelineEvent.grabbed = false;\n    if (stretchMode) stretchMode = false;\n\n    _timelineEvent.transform.position = highlight.transform.position;\n    _timelineEvent.transform.rotation = highlight.transform.rotation;\n\n    highlight.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;\n    highlight.transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;\n\n    _timelineEvent.transform.parent = timelineTransform;\n    _timelineEvent.recalcTrackPosition();\n\n    _timelineEvent.toggleEdges(true);\n\n    _timelineEvent.overlapCheck();\n}\n\ncurState = state;\n\nif (curState == manipState.none || multiselected) {\n    highlight.SetActive(true);\n    //FIXED CODE:\n    if(curState == manipState.none) \n        highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", .9f);\n```\n\nIn the corrected version, I have removed the redundant or unnecessary conditions. Also, the condition is replaced with more readable if statement. If `curState` is `manipState.none` or `multiselected` is true, then the highlight will be active. The emission gain of the highlight material will be set to 0.9 only when `curState` is `manipState.none`."
