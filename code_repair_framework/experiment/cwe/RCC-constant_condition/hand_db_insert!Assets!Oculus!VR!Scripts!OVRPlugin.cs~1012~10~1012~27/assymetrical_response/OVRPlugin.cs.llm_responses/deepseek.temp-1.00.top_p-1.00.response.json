    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like your code is cut off before showing any content for the enum \"Hand_End\". If you're trying to define a set of constants for use in your code, here's a general example of how to do it:\n\n```csharp\npublic enum Hand_End\n{\n    Left,   // or 0\n    Right   // or 1\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, \"Hand_End\" is the enum name. The values \"Left\" and \"Right\" represent the different options of the enum. You can access these values by using the enum name and the value, like so:\n\n```csharp\nHand_End myHand = Hand_End.Left; // myHand will be set to \"Left\"\n```\n\nIf you show more of your code, I can provide more specific guidance."
