    "code_repairing_1": "private readonly List<IMixedRealityInputSource> touchingSources;\n\nIt seems you are encountering a warning message about an unused collection. This warning is shown because you have declared a list of IMixedRealityInputSource types but you haven't used it anywhere in your code.\n\nThe code itself seems to be fine other than the unused list declaration. However, if this collection never gets queried or accessed in your code, then it is indeed completely unused. It might be left over from older untested code or might serve some use case in some part of your program. If such case is not necessary, you can safely remove it.\n\n```C#\n// Unused property\n// private readonly List<IMixedRealityInputSource> touchingSources = new List<IMixedRealityInputSource>();\n```\n\nYour warning about the collection/list being \"the contents are never queried or accessed\" means that this list is not being used anywhere in your functionality. So if you don't plan to use `touchingSources` anywhere else in your code, you can consider removing this.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Since your code snippet provided suggests that the variable 'touchingSources' is not used or accessed anywhere in your code, it can be removed or commented out.
