    "code_repairing_0": "It appears you have started an incomplete script for a custom editor for a `CanvasRenderTexture` in Unity with Oculus Interaction. \n\nGiven that `CanvasRenderTexture` is a specific Oculus SDK object and `CanvasRenderer` is a Unity UI object, their inspection and editing are handled by custom inspectors provided by Oculus SDK and Unity SDK respectively. \n\nHowever, from your code, it seems you are trying to extend the custom editor for `CanvasRenderTexture` and include UI-based functionalities. This is a bit unusual and may not work as expected. Unity's custom editors are meant to handle a specific class or asset's editable properties, and Unity UI elements (`CanvasRenderer`) do not have corresponding custom inspectors.\n\nIf you are trying to extend the properties that can be edited via a custom inspector, you typically do so by overriding the `OnInspectorGUI` method in a custom editor. Here is an example usage:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEditor;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n[CustomEditor(typeof(YourScript))]\npublic class YourScriptEditor : Editor\n{\n    public override void OnInspectorGUI()\n    {\n        base.OnInspectorGUI();\n\n        YourScript myScript = (YourScript)target;\n        if (myScript.someProperty)\n        {\n            myScript.someProperty = EditorGUILayout.IntField(\"Some Property\", myScript.someProperty);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will show a slider in the inspector for `someProperty` in your `YourScript` class.\n\nIf your intention is different, could you please provide more context or clarify your question?",
    "code_repairing_1": "It looks like you're trying to create a custom editor for a Unity class called `CanvasRenderTexture` using the Oculus Interaction library. The editor code you've provided seems to be structured correctly, but it's missing the main body of the custom editor logic which needs to be enclosed between `OnInspectorGUI` and `OnEnable` methods.\n\nHere's a basic example of what your code may look like, assuming you want to show some properties and handle property changes:\n\n```C#\nusing Oculus.Interaction.Editor;\nusing Oculus.Interaction.UnityCanvas.Editor;\nusing Oculus.Interaction.UnityCanvas.CanvasRenderTexture.Properties;\nusing UnityEditor;\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\n[CustomEditor(typeof(CanvasRenderTexture))]\npublic class CanvasRenderTextureEditor : EditorBase\n{\n    private static List<CanvasRenderer> _tmpRenderers = new List<CanvasRenderer>();\n\n    private SerializedProperty _prop1;\n    private SerializedProperty _prop2;\n\n    protected override void OnEnable()\n    {\n        base.OnEnable();\n\n        _prop1 = serializedObject.FindProperty(\"_prop1\");\n        _prop2 = serializedObject.FindProperty(\"_prop2\");\n    }\n\n    public override void OnInspectorGUI()\n    {\n        serializedObject.Update();\n\n        EditorGUILayout.PropertyField(_prop1);\n        EditorGUILayout.PropertyField(_prop2);\n\n        if (GUI.changed)\n        {\n            EditorUtility.SetDirty(target);\n        }\n\n        serializedObject.ApplyModifiedProperties();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code assumes you have two private fields in your `CanvasRenderTexture` class named `_prop1` and `_prop2`, replace them with your property names. This code will show those properties in the inspector and save changes if they've been edited. You'll need to replace `target` in `EditorUtility.SetDirty(target)` with the actual GameObject that's going to get changed by this custom editor.\n\nPlease provide more specific requirements if you need a more specific editor logic.",
