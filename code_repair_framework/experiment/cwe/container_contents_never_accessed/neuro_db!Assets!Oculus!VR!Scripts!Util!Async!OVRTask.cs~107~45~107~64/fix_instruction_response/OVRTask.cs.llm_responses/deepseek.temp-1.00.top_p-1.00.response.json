    "code_repairing_0": "The code you provided seems to be a part of an application related to tasks and its management. You didn't ask a question, but I understood you want a code review. Here is a review of your code:\n\n1. The warning about a collection that is never accessed is a bit off-topic. However, since you have static dictionary `CallbackInvokers` and `CallbackRemovers`, we would better to keep these collections and remove unused references inside them.\n\n2. You might have misunderstood by your comment \"BUG: Container contents are never accessed\". It is not a bug, but a potential overuse or misuse of memory. C#'s garbage collector does a pretty good job on cleanning up unused memory. If you really want to control memory, you could implement IDisposable interface on your `OVRTask<TResult>` to dispose resources when it is not needed anymore.\n\n3. Your class `OVRTask<TResult>` does not seem to handle exceptions, so adding try-catch blocks to each method could be a useful approach for error handling.\n\n4. It's not clear what your `OVRTask<TResult>` is supposed to do, especially in terms of `Pending`, `Results`, `Continuations`, `CallbackInvokers`, `CallbackRemovers`, `CallbackClearers` and `InternalDataRemovers`. Providing a clear use-case scenario would help in understanding and improving the code.\n\n5. Ensure proper naming and code style. For example, method names should be descriptive and follow camelCase.\n\n6. The code is not complete and there are some methods like `Create`, `GetId` that are not implemented.\n\n7. It seems that the purpose of your code is to manage async operations with tasks. However, your current code structure does not lend itself to this. It could be designed more naturally for sync operations and could be overcomplicating things.\n\nOverall, it seems like a good start, but the exact requirements should clarify the purpose and use-case of this code.",

    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you have removed the code related to the `InternalDataClearers` HashSet which is used for clearing all the stored data related to the generic type `TResult` in the static class OVRTask.
