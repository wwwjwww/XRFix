    "code_repairing_2": "Your code seems to be incomplete but as per my understanding, you might be looking for ways to optimize your code or perform certain operations. Here's a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Replace bool flag**: You are using a bool variable `phantomHitUpdate` that doesn't seem to be used anywhere. You could potentially remove this to optimize memory.\n\n2. **Remove Queue**: The Queue in your code is not being used anywhere. You might want to remove it to keep your code clean and efficient.\n\n3. **Optimize Material Assignment**: In the Awake method, you are creating a new Material `glowMat` with `onMat` as its base, but you are not using this `glowMat` anywhere. You could potentially change this to optimize memory.\n\n4. **Lazy Initialization**: The variable `_deviceInterface` is being initialized in the `Awake` method. The `Start` method is called after all GameObjects have been initialized. If you require accessing this variable during the `Start` method, consider calling `GetComponent<deviceInterface>` during the `Awake` method.\n\nPlease provide the rest of your code for more specific recommendations, as without the full context this is pretty general advice.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The code you've posted contains a few issues. The first issue is that there's no mention of a `setState` method, which doesn't seem to be present in the provided code. Therefore, `keyHitCheck` and `setSelectAsynch` methods are assuming that the `curState` member is either `touching` or `grabbed`, and the `toggled` member is also used. \n\nAlso, the `on` condition in the `keyHitCheck` method is dependant on the `touching`, `curState`, and `toggled` members. If these variables don't exist (likely as they don't appear in the provided code snippet), this will cause issues. \n\nFinally, there's a piece of commented-out code that has a `Queue` of type `bool`, which is never queried or modified. If this queue is not used elsewhere, you can comment it out or delete it to resolve the \"Container contents are never accessed\" issue.\n\n```csharp\npublic override void Awake() {\n  base.Awake();\n  _deviceInterface = transform.parent.GetComponent<deviceInterface>();\n  rend = GetComponent<Renderer>();\n  offMat = rend.material;\n  glowMat = new Material(onMat);\n  glowMat.SetColor(\"_TintColor\", glowColor);\n}\n\nbool initialized = false;\nvoid Start() {\n  initialized = true;\n}\n\npublic void setOffMat(Material m) {\n  rend.material = m;\n  offMat = rend.material;\n}\n\npublic bool isHit = false;\n\npublic void keyHitCheck() {\n  if (!initialized) return;\n  bool on = touching || curState == manipState.grabbed || toggled;\n\n  if (on != isHit) {\n    isHit = on;\n  AI Programming Assistant\n\nBased on your code, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. You should have a `manipObject` class or interface that contains the properties and methods that `manipState` can depend on. Then, `manipState` should contain a reference to a `manipObject` or an interface that `manipObject` implements. This way, `key` can depend on `manipObject` and will have access to the properties and methods of `manipObject` without knowing the details of how these properties and methods are implemented.\n\n2. If `toggled` is true, then the object should be highlighted as if it was interacting with the player. You can use the `setSelectAsynch` method to highlight the object as the player interacts with it.\n\n3. The `setOffMat` method can be used to change the material of the object when it is not highlighted.\n\n4. The `keyHitCheck` method can be used to check if the player has interacted with the object and make the appropriate changes based on the interaction.\n\n5. Make sure to uncomment the necessary parts of your code when you add them. The warning about `Queue` not being used or accessed is because it's declared but never used or modified.\n\nRemember, the code you've posted is quite incomplete. Without more information, it's hard to provide a comprehensive solution.",
