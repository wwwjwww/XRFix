    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you've started writing code snippet for a key object in a Unity game. However, your message got cut off. Could you please provide the rest of the code or clear the question? I'm here to help you with any computer science or programming related questions you may have, and I might be able to help with this Unity code.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you are developing a key object in Unity using C#. However, your code is missing the `fixed code` part, which seems to be the main part of your key class implementation. That part should contain the logic to handle the key states and interactions with the environment.\n\nPlease provide the missing `fixed code` part, and I would be happy to help you further with your Unity and C# code.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you have posted a portion of code related to a key object in a Unity project. However, you haven't asked a question. Please provide a question or issue related to this code so I can assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code seems to be incomplete and incomplete. It does not contain the definition for the function `manipObject` or `deviceInterface` so I cannot fully understand what your code is doing. However, based on the code snippet you provided, it seems to be related to a Unity C# script. \n\nIt appears to be creating a 'key' that can be toggled on and off depending on whether it is being manipulated or not. The key has an associated value that is determined when the key is toggled on, then it communicates this information to a script that contains higher-level controls over the behavior of the device. \n\nThis script has a 'glow' effect to indicate when the key is being manipulated or hit by an object. It also has the ability to set itself as 'on' or 'off' (selected state). \n\nBut without the complete context of the codebase or the problem, it's difficult to provide a more detailed analysis or suggest more appropriate solutions.",
    "code_repairing_4": "After your question, you did not ask a question so I'm not sure what you need help with. This seems like it might be a continuation of a larger Unity program related to keys and manipulation objects. \n\nIf you have a specific issue or a question specific to your code, and you would like help with it, please provide additional details or specify the issue you are experiencing."
