    "code_repairing_1": "Your code seems to be incomplete. Please provide the missing part of your code so I can assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like your code is for a Unity key object script. It seems incomplete but it covers a few essential parts of a key object for a virtual reality game. Here's what is missing or incomplete in your script:\n\n1. The `keyHitCheck()` function has not been completed yet which seems to be the point of interaction with the key. This function seems to be checking if the key is being touched or grabbed or toggled and sends an event with `keyValue`.\n\n2. The `setSelectAsynch` function seems to be meant to set the selection state of the key object, which might be used to show different visual effects when the key is selected or not.\n\n3. There is a boolean variable `phantomHitUpdate` but no code path for updating it or using it.\n\n4. There are a few variables related to the state of the key: `sticky`, `isKeyboard`, `toggled`, etc. But they are not related to the `keyHitCheck()` function. The `toggled` variable seems to exist, but it's not used or referenced anywhere.\n\n5. The script seems to be missing a `FixedUpdate()` or `Update()` function that is invoked on every physics frame or frame. These will be required for physics-based interactions with the key object.\n\nI hope this helps! If you provide more of the code, I might be able to help you more.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It looks like you're writing a script with Unity and C# where you seem to have a class inheriting from a `manipObject` class. The script is mostly related to manipulation and interaction with the user interface of a device.\n\nHowever, your script isn't closed and it's missing some sections like the function to update the states of the key when the script runs and update the material of the key when it's being touched or grabbed.\n\nDo you have any specific question or issue related to this script that you want to see resolved? I can provide you with a more detailed answer or at least give you a hint how to continue working on it.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you have a class named \"key\" in Unity using C#. The class extends the \"manipObject\" class, which might mean it is involved in some kind of object manipulation. \n\nThis class has several key properties and properties related to materials and colors, as well as a few others related to device interaction. There is also an override function \"Awake\" and a \"keyHitCheck\" function.\n\nThe class also contains an enum \"keyState\" which could be used for different states of a key (e.g., off, touched, grabbedOn, grabbedOff, selectedOff, selectedOn). \n\nFinally, there are several functions related to the selection (i.e., setting the state of the key asynchronously) of the key, with the possibility of being \"on\" or \"off\".\n\nCould you provide more specific information about the parts or sections of the code that you'd like assistance with?"
