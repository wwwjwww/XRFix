    "code_repairing_0": "You didn't ask a specific question, but you provided a block of code with no question mark to ask. This is an example of how you might refactor your code to check if objects are held by two hands and if objects are held by both hands, destroy them.\n\nIn your current script, you have a reference to the left hand and the right hand interactors. You can get the transform of these interactors in the start function to avoid null reference errors. You can then get the transform of the object being held by each hand in the update function. If the object is held by both hands, you can destroy it.\n\nHere's an example of how you could refactor your code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit;\n\npublic class DestroyBuggedHeldBricks : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public XRInteractionManager _interactionManager;\n\n    public XRDirectInteractor leftHand;\n    public XRDirectInteractor rightHand;\n\n    private Transform _leftHandTransform;\n    private Transform _rightHandTransform;\n    private Transform _heldObjectTransform;\n\n    // Start is called before the first frame update\n    void Start()\n    {\n        _leftHandTransform = leftHand.transform;\n        _rightHandTransform = rightHand.transform;\n    }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (leftHand.selectTarget != null)\n        {\n            _heldObjectTransform = leftHand.selectTarget.transform;\n            CheckForBothHands();\n        }\n\n        if (rightHand.selectTarget != null)\n        {\n            _heldObjectTransform = rightHand.selectTarget.transform;\n            CheckForBothHands();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void CheckForBothHands()\n    {\n        if (_heldObjectTransform.parent == _leftHandTransform || _heldObjectTransform.parent == _rightHandTransform)\n        {\n            Destroy(_heldObjectTransform.gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease replace the `XRInteractionManager`, `leftHand`, and `rightHand` with your actual references. This code will destroy any GameObject that is held by both hands. If you only want to destroy specific types of GameObjects, you will need to add checks to see if the parent of the GameObject has a specific type or tag.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It looks like you have left the code for your `Start` and `Update` methods. Please provide the rest of your code so that I can help you debug it.",
    "code_repairing_2": "I'm sorry, but your problem is not clear. Please provide more details or code to understand what's going wrong. I would be happy to help you debug your code if you provide more specific information.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code seems incomplete. But based on the context, I assume that you want to destroy objects that are being held by both left and right hands. If so, here is a possible implementation of this behaviour. \n\nPlease replace `Bugged` with the actual name of the objects you want to destroy.\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit;\n\npublic class DestroyBuggedHeldBricks : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public XRInteractionManager _interactionManager;\n    public XRDirectInteractor leftHand;\n    public XRDirectInteractor rightHand;\n    private List<GameObject> leftHandGrabbedObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n    private List<GameObject> rightHandGrabbedObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        FindGrabbedObjects();\n        CheckForBuggedInteractions();\n    }\n\n    private void FindGrabbedObjects()\n    {\n        leftHandGrabbedObjects.Clear();\n        rightHandGrabbedObjects.Clear();\n\n        foreach (var interactable in _interactionManager.selectEntries)\n        {\n            if (interactable.interactors.Contains(leftHand) && interactable.gameObject.name.Contains(\"Bugged\"))\n            {\n                leftHandGrabbedObjects.Add(interactable.gameObject);",
    "code_repairing_4": "You didn't ask a question, so I'm going to make a few assumptions about what you'd like help with here.\n\nDo you need assistance with implementing a script where if a specific object (brick) is held by the left hand and right hand then destroy that object? If so, you can modify the script like this:\n\n```C#\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit;\n\npublic class DestroyBuggedHeldBricks : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public XRInteractionManager _interactionManager;\n\n    public XRDirectInteractor leftHand;\n    public XRDirectInteractor rightHand;\n\n    private Transform _leftHandTransform;\n    private Transform _rightHandTransform;\n\n    // Start is called before the first frame update\n    void Start()\n    {\n        _leftHandTransform = leftHand.transform;\n        _rightHandTransform = rightHand.transform;\n    }\n\n    // Update is called once per frame\n    void Update()\n    {\n        CheckForBuggedHeldBricks();\n    }\n\n    private void CheckForBuggedHeldBricks()\n    {\n        // check if there is an object held by left and right hand\n        if (leftHand.selectTarget != null && rightHand.selectTarget != null)\n        {\n            // check if the object is a brick\n            if (leftHand.selectTarget.gameObject.tag == \"Brick\" && rightHand.selectTarget.gameObject.tag == \"Brick\")\n            {\n                // destroy the brick\n                Destroy(leftHand.selectTarget.gameObject);\n                Destroy(rightHand.selectTarget.gameObject);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis script will check if there are objects held by both hands, and if they are tagged as \"Brick\", it will destroy them. Note that you need to assign the \"Brick\" tag to the prefab of the object you want to check.\n\nRemember to attach both hand interactors and interaction manager to the script in Unity, so it can reference them properly. Also, this code should be attached to the main camera of your scene, or another object that exists in your scene."
