    "code_repairing_0": "In your original code, there is an issue with a HashSet that is never accessed. To fix this, you can add a method that accesses this HashSet. Here's the changed code:\n\n````\nprivate static class Storage<T> where T : class, new()\n{\n    public static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n}\n\npublic static void UseStorage()\n{\n    // Uses the HashSet for a purpose\n    // This will force usage and access to HashSet contents which solves the problem\n    foreach (T item in Storage<T>.HashSet)\n    {\n        // Do something with item\n    }\n}\n````\nIn the fixed code, I added a 'UseStorage' method that uses the HashSet. It will force Unity to actually instantiate the HashSet because it's never accessed. This forces Unity to output the contents of that HashSet, which solves the issue. The original code was incorrect as the HashSet was declared as a field in the nested Storage class but wasn't accessed or used anywhere in the class, which is a wasteful waste of space and system resource.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Here is the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nprivate static class Storage<T> where T : class, new()\n{\n    public static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n}\n```\n\nThe bug was due to the HashSet not being used anywhere, so it was essentially doing unnecessary processing and was producing a useless warning. By initializing HashSet and making it public, it will now be accessible and usage can be tracked.",
