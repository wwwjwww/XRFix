You also have a generic Storage class, but it is not being used. Instead, you have a list for storing items. You can add an item to the list, get an item using its index, and clear the list to remove all items. This way, the container is being accessed but not always queried.",
    "code_repairing_1": "You need to add a method to access the HashSet. This way, you'll be able to access the contents and avoid the warning message. Please replace `<T>` with your own class.\n\nHere is the fixed code:\n\n```C#\npublic class OVRObjectPool\n{\n    private static class Storage<T> where T : class, new()\n    {\n        public static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n    }\n\n    // Access the HashSet. You can add more functionality to this method\n    // based on your specific use case.\n    public static HashSet<T> GetStorage<T>() where T : class, new()\n    {\n        return Storage<T>.HashSet;\n    }\n}\n```",
    "code_repairing_2": "public static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of your code\n}\n\nAbove, I fixed the warning by moving the declaration of `HashSet` to a public static `readonly` field.",
    "code_repairing_3": "public static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n\nHashSet is being used to store instances of T and when these instances are returned to the pool, their identity can be checked and the appropriate instances removed from the set to ensure that no unnecessary duplicates are added. \n\nHere's an example where I make use of HashSet:\n\n```csharp\npublic static class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        Storage<MyClass>.HashSet.Add(new MyClass());\n        Storage<MyClass>.HashSet.Add(new MyClass());\n\n        foreach (var item in Storage<MyClass>.HashSet)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(item);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class MyClass\n{\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return \"MyClass\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, even if a `new MyClass()` is added to the `HashSet` twice, it will only print out `MyClass` once since `HashSet` does not allow duplicate entries. This is why accessing the contents of this collection would not be useful, but it will prevent unnecessary memory usage due to duplicate instances being kept in memory.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\npublic static readonly HashSet<T> HashSet = new HashSet<T>();\n```\n\nThe original code snippet was using `HashSet` to store instances of `T`, but it seems that the contents of `HashSet` are never accessed or queried, hence the warning. This warning suggests that it might be an error, because `HashSet` is never being used.\n\nHere is the fixed code:\n\nYou need to decide what operations you want to perform on the objects in the pool. If you need to check their existence, you may need to access them, in which case, they should be in a collection that can allow that. Therefore, you may need to choose a different collection type or make adjustments as needed.\n\nHowever, if you simply want to keep objects until they are explicitly removed from the pool, there is no need for any operations on the collection. If it's purely an optimization concern, you may consider using a `Stack<T>` or `Queue<T>`, depending on your usage."
