    "code_repairing_0": "From your code, it appears that you may have a bug with the initialization of your `savedRooms` array. The code snippet where it's supposed to instantiate rooms seems to be missing.\n\nYou should initialize your `savedRooms` array with the game objects instantiated by your prefab `recentRoomPrefab`, and you should also instantiate the game objects corresponding to each room code.\n\nIf you want to use the `userSettings`, make sure that the `userSettings` field of your `MonoBehaviour` is correctly set and linked to an appropriate `ScriptableObject` in the Unity inspector.\n\nIf you want to use the `SessionManager`, make sure that the `SessionManager` field of your `MonoBehaviour` is correctly set and linked to the appropriate component or script in the Unity inspector.\n\nIf you want to use the `recentRoomsRoomCodes`, make sure that the `recentRoomsRoomCodes` field of your `MonoBehaviour` is correctly set and linked to the corresponding TextMeshProUGUI game objects in the Unity inspector.\n\nIf you want to use the `recentRoomsNames`, make sure that the `recentRoomsNames` field of your `MonoBehaviour` is correctly set and linked to the corresponding TextMeshProUGUI game objects in the Unity inspector.\n\nIf you want to use the `recentRoomsBrickCounts`, make sure that the `recentRoomsBrickCounts` field of your `MonoBehaviour` is correctly set and linked to the corresponding TextMeshProUGUI game objects in the Unity inspector.\n\nAnd remember that the `pagedScroll` should be properly set and linked to the PagedScroll game object in the Unity inspector.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Based on the message you provided, it appears that the Unity Dev Assist was unable to find what the problem is in your code. It's important to provide a snippet of your code for further assistance. It seems to be dealing with loading a list of saved rooms. The code seems to be okay except for one point which is the container contents are not accessed and so, are not beneficial.\n\nSo, we can replace `List<string> roomNamesToLoad = new List<string>();` with `savedRooms = new GameObject[NumberOfRoomsToLoad];`. This should fix the problem.\n\nHere is the corrected part of the code:\n\n```csharp\nprivate GameObject[] savedRooms;\n\nprivate void InitializeSavedRoomsList()\n{\n    string[] rooms = FindSaves();\n\n    if (rooms.Length <= 0)\n    {\n        RenderNoSavedRooms();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    savedRooms = new GameObject[NumberOfRoomsToLoad];\n    for (int i = 0; i < rooms.Length && i < NumberOfRoomsToLoad; i++)\n    {\n        savedRooms[i] = rooms[i];\n    }\n\n    LoadRoomData();\n}\n```\n\nIn the modified code, we have initialized an array of GameObjects with the specified size and filled it with the saved rooms' names. Then, we call `LoadRoomData()` to load the data from each room. This method is not defined in your code, but it's recommended to create one to handle the loading of room data based on the saved rooms' names.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It looks like there's a problem with accessing the contents of the `savedRooms` array. Please replace the code as follows to properly access its content:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void InitializeSavedRoomsList()\n{\n    string[] rooms = FindSaves();\n    savedRooms = new GameObject[rooms.Length];\n\n    if(rooms.Length <= 0) {\n        RenderNoSavedRooms();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < rooms.Length; i++)\n    {\n        savedRooms[i] = Instantiate(recentRoomPrefab, savedRoomsObject.transform);\n        TextMeshProUGUI[] roomElements = {\n            savedRooms[i].transform.GetChild(0).GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>(), // Room Code\n            savedRooms[i].transform.GetChild(1).GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>(), // Room Name\n            savedRooms[i].transform.GetChild(2).GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>()  // Room Brick Count\n        };\n        recentRoomsRoomCodes[i] = roomElements[0];\n        recentRoomsNames[i] = roomElements[1];\n        recentRoomsBrickCounts[i] = roomElements[2];\n        \n        string[] roomData = File.ReadAllLines(rooms[i]);\n        recentRoomsRoomCodes[i].text = roomData[0];\n        recentRoomsNames[i].text = _textInfo.ToTitleCase(roomData[1]);\n        recentRoomsBrickCounts[i].text = roomData[2];\n    }\n\n    pagedScroll.EnableButtons();\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `savedRooms` is instantiated to have a length equal to the number of rooms found. Each instantiation is associated with the `recentRoomPrefab` which is assumed to have 3 children: a TextMeshProUGUI for the room code, another for the room name, and another for the brick count. \n\nIn the next part of the code, we retrieve the individual room data (room code, name, and brick count) from each save file (`rooms[i]`) and assign it to the corresponding `TextMeshProUGUI` components on the instantiated `savedRooms` objects.\n\nThis code should solve the issue you had with the content being never accessed. It's also important to remember that error and warning messages are typically helpful hints about potential problems, so please don't hesitate to take a look at them if you encounter any issues.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It appears there is a missing part in your OnEnable function. I am assuming you want to initialize your savedRooms array and populate it with data from your saves directory. Here's how you could modify your `OnEnable` function to achieve this:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void OnEnable()\n{\n    _textInfo = new CultureInfo(\"en-US\", false).TextInfo;\n    savedRooms = new GameObject[NumberOfRoomsToLoad]; // Initialize the array to the desired length\n    recentRoomsRoomCodes = new TextMeshProUGUI[NumberOfRoomsToLoad]; // Initialize the array to the desired length\n    recentRoomsNames = new TextMeshProUGUI[NumberOfRoomsToLoad]; // Initialize the array to the desired length\n    recentRoomsBrickCounts = new TextMeshProUGUI[NumberOfRoomsToLoad]; // Initialize the array to the desired length\n    RenderSavedRoomsList();\n}\n\nprivate string[] FindSaves()\n{\n    if(!Directory.Exists($\"{(Application.isEditor ? Application.dataPath : Application.persistentDataPath)}/saves/\"))\n        Directory.CreateDirectory($\"{(Application.isEditor ? Application.dataPath : Application.persistentDataPath)}/saves/\");\n    \n    return Directory.GetFiles($\"{(Application.isEditor ? Application.dataPath : Application.persistentDataPath)}/saves/\")\n        .Where(file => file.EndsWith(\".bricks\")).ToArray();\n}\n```\n\nPlease note, this code assumes that the `recentRoomsRoomCodes`, `recentRoomsNames`, and `recentRoomsBrickCounts` arrays are being populated with `TextMeshProUGUI` components that are attached to the same objects in the `savedRooms` array. This is a common pattern in Unity when you have a list of items to populate, and you want to store references to their UI components.\n\nThe missing part in your OnEnable function has been added to initialize the `savedRooms` array, `recentRoomsRoomCodes`, `recentRoomsNames` and `recentRoomsBrickCounts` arrays. The `savedRooms` array will hold the game objects representing the rooms, and the other arrays will hold references to the UI components that display the data about these rooms.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you are trying to initialize a list of room names to be loaded from saved rooms. However, the 'rooms' variable in your code is not being queried or accessed, which would lead to the warning you are seeing. In order to solve this, you should make sure that at least part of your code is responsible for accessing or querying the contents of the 'rooms' variable. Here's a possible fix:\n\n```csharp\nif (rooms.Length <= 0)\n{\n    RenderNoSavedRooms();\n    return;\n}\n        \nsavedRooms = new GameObject[rooms.Length];\nrecentRoomsRoomCodes = new TextMeshProUGUI[rooms.Length];\nrecentRoomsNames = new TextMeshProUGUI[rooms.Length];\nrecentRoomsBrickCounts = new TextMeshProUGUI[rooms.Length];\n     \nfor (int i = 0; i < rooms.Length; i++)\n{\n    GameObject roomObject = Instantiate(recentRoomPrefab, savedRoomsObject.transform);\n    savedRooms[i] = roomObject;\n\n    recentRoomsRoomCodes[i] = roomObject.transform.Find(\"RoomCode\").GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>();\n    recentRoomsNames[i] = roomObject.transform.Find(\"RoomName\").GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>();\n    recentRoomsBrickCounts[i] = roomObject.transform(\".BrickCount\").GetComponent<TextMeshProUGUI>(\"BrickCount\");\n\n    // Assuming the RoomCode property is named as \"roomCode\", RoomName property is named as \"roomName\" and\n    // RoomBrickCount property is named as \"brickCount\"\n    // Fill in the room's data.\n    // savedRooms[i].roomCode = GetRoomCodeFromSaveFile(rooms[i]);\n    // savedRooms[i].roomName = GetRoomNameFromSaveFile(rooms[i]);\n    // savedRooms[i].brickCount = GetBrickCountFromSaveFile(rooms[i]);\n\n    // Ensure to attach a button event to load the specific room\n    // roomObject.GetComponentInChildren<Button>().onClick.AddListener(() => LoadRoom(rooms[i]));\n}\npagedScroll.EnableButtons();\n```\n\nFor the code that doesn't run as you intended, you'll need to be able to look at the rest of your code. Are you sure you're not facing this issue in the LoadGameFromSave() method? Please provide it for a more precise solution. \n\nAnd remember to replace the commented parts with the actual logic for getting room code, room name, and brick count from the save file."
