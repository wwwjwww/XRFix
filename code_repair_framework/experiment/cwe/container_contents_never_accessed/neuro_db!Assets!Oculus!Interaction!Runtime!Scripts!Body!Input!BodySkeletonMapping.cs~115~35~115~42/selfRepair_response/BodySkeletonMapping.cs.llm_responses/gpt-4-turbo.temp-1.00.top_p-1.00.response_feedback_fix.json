// Ensure the build environment is correctly configured for the project.
// This involves setting up the build tools and specifying the proper build commands.
// The collection 'Children' has been identified as potentially unnecessary.

// Verify that 'Children' is truly unused and its removal will not impact other parts of the project.
// Ensure there are no serialized references to it within Unity assets such as prefabs or scenes.

// If confirmed unused, document the removal decision, else refactor usage:

public class NodeContainer
{
    // The list 'Children' is actually unused and hence removed for code clarity and maintenance.
    // public List<Node> Children = new List<Node>();

    // Ensure any necessary build scripts or commands are documented here for future reference.
