    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you've accidentally cut off the rest of the class definition for `FoldoutGroup<T>`. However, based on your comment in the code, this class seems to be holding the information for an individual group in the hierarchy and the details of its children.\n\nAssuming your code is meant to add a child to the FoldoutGroup, the `AddChild` method might look like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic void AddChild(FoldoutGroup<T> child, FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> item, bool isLeaf)\n{\n    child._parent = this;\n    if (isLeaf)\n    {\n        child.AddItem(item);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        child.AddItem(new FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> { path = child.Name, item = default(T), onDraw = (item) => { } });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd you will also need an `AddItem` method:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void AddItem(FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> item)\n{\n    _children.Add(item);\n}\n```\n\nThe `Draw` method is also left to be completed, assuming you want to draw the Foldout for each child:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Draw()\n{\n    if (_children.Count == 0) return;\n\n    var foldedOut = EditorGUILayout.Foldout(_expanded, _name);\n    _expanded = EditorGUILayout.BeginFoldoutGroup(foldedOut, _name);\n\n    if (_expanded)\n    {\n        foreach (var child in _children)\n        {\n            // Handle drawing and interaction with child\n            // You would call Draw() or onDraw action here\n        }\n\n        EditorGUILayout.EndFoldoutGroup();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote: Be sure to add a `_expanded` field to your `FoldoutGroup<T>` class to save the state of expanded/collapsed foldouts.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you want to implement a nested Foldout functionality in Unity. You have a FoldoutGroup class that should have methods for adding child groups. The FoldoutGroup holds a list of children, and might be responsible for drawing itself and its children. However, you have not provided any further code or a direction for the implementation of the missing methods in the FoldoutGroup class. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```C#\npublic class FoldoutGroup<T>\n{\n    private bool _isFolded = true;\n    private string _name;\n    private FoldoutGroup<T> _parent;\n    private List<FoldoutGroup<T>> _children = new List<FoldoutGroup<T>>();\n    private List<FoldoutHierarchyItem<T>> _data = new List<FoldoutHierarchyItem<T>>();\n\n    public FoldoutGroup(string name)\n    {\n        _name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void AddChild(FoldoutGroup<T> child, FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> item, bool isLast)\n    {\n        child._parent = this;\n        if (!isLast)\n        {\n            _children.Add(child);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            _data.Add(item);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Draw()\n    {\n        _isFolded = EditorGUILayout.Foldout(_isFolded, _name);\n        if (!_isFolded)\n        {\n            foreach (FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> item in _data)\n            {\n                item.onDraw(item.item);\n            }\n            foreach (FoldoutGroup<T> child in _children)\n            {\n                child.Draw();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code defines a FoldoutGroup which is able to draw itself and its children, and to handle child items and groups. It uses Unity's `EditorGUILayout.Foldout` method to create a Foldout effect, which collapses and expands based on user interaction.\n  \nThe FoldoutGroup has a list of children which are other FoldoutGroup instances. The FoldoutGroup also has a list of FoldoutHierarchyItems, which are the items at the end of hierarchy paths. Each item has an `onDraw` delegate, which is called when the item is drawn. The `Draw` method of the FoldoutGroup checks whether the foldout is collapsed (hidden) or expanded (visible). If expanded, it draws each item and then each child FoldoutGroup. If collapsed, it simply draws the label as the foldout.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Looks like your code is in need of an additional class to handle the foldout group logic. I suggest creating a new class named `FoldoutGroup`. However, your current code doesn't show how the class should be implemented. If there are specific functionalities you're looking for, please provide more context so I can better assist you.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The rest of your code seems to be missing. However, from what you've provided, it looks like you're trying to create a `FoldoutGroup` class. This class seems to have a `AddChild` method which might be responsible for handling a group's children.\n\nThis is the incomplete code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class FoldoutGroup<T>\n{\n    private string _name;\n    private FoldoutGroup<T> _parent;\n    private List<object> _children = new List<object>();\n    //         private List<FoldoutHierarchyItem<T>> _data = new List<FoldoutHierarchyItem<T>>();\n\n    public FoldoutGroup(string name)\n    {\n        _name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void AddChild(FoldoutGroup<T> child, FoldoutHierarchyItem<T> item, bool isLast)\n    {\n        _children.Add(new { Child = child, Item = item, IsLast = isLast });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that this code will not compile as is, because you are adding an object to `_children` which is not defined in the class. You would need to define a custom class to hold your data, or remove the type checking feature of C#. If you need further help with your code, please provide the rest of it."
