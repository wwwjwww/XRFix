The issue is that the code is trying to get all the scenes in the project and then check if each scene's name contains the input name. This could be slow if there are many scenes in the project.\n\nThe solution is to directly use `SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i)` to get the scene at index `i` instead of using `SceneManager.GetAllScenes()`. This way, you only get the scenes that are currently loaded into memory, not all scenes in the project.\n\nAlso, the `Contains` method is case insensitive. If you want to ensure that the comparison is case sensitive, you can remove the `ToLower()` calls.\n\nThe rest of your code seems correct and does not need any changes as per Unity's recommendation.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The code provided is a utility function for getting the name of a scene from its path. It uses the `System.IO.Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` method to retrieve the base name of the file (without extension) from the path.
