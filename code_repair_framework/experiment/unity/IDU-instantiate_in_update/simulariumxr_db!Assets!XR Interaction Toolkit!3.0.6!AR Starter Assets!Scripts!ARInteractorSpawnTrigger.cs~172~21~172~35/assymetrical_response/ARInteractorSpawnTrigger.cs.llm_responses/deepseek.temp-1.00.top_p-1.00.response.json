    "code_repairing_0": "Yes, you can solve this issue by creating an object pool before the Update() method has been called. An object pool is a cache of object instances which can be reused. This way, the objects won't be created every frame, which would be a problem if you're instantiating new objects every frame in Update().\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject method will return a bool indicating whether the spawn was successful. This is a useful way to handle spawning, enabling you to verify if the spawn was successful without having to rely on an exception or error message. This would allow you to handle the spawn in a more controlled manner.\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```C#\npublic class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // Assuming you have an ObjectPooler script set up in your project\n    public ObjectPooler objectPooler; \n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        if (m_ObjectSpawner == null)\n            m_ObjectSpawner = FindObjectOfType<ObjectSpawner>();\n\n        if (m_ARInteractor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Missing AR Interactor reference, disabling component.\", this);\n            enabled = false;\n        }\n\n        // Create an object pool on Start\n        objectPooler = ObjectPooler.Instance;\n        if (objectPooler != null)\n        {\n            objectPooler.CreatePool(m_ObjectSpawner.objectPrefabs);\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n        {\n            m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n            var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n            if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n            {\n                if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                    return;\n\n                if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                    return;\n                \n                // Use TrySpawnObject to control whether the spawn was successful\n                bool isSpawnSuccessful = m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n                if (isSpawnSuccessful)\n                {\n                    // If spawn was successful, get the spawned object from the object pool\n                    GameObject spawnedObject = objectPooler.GetPooledObject();\n                    if (spawnedObject != null)\n                    {\n                        // Here you can adjust the spawnedObject as needed (position, rotation...)...\n                        // ... and handle its interactions with the rest of your code\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        // Rest of the Update...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace `ObjectPooler` with the name of your actual object pooling script.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The issue you're experiencing seems to be a performance problem. The `Update()` method is being called every frame, and if it contains expensive operations like instantiating objects, it can lead to inefficient usage of computational resources and performance hits.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can implement object pooling, which allows for the reuse of objects rather than creating a new one each time. Object pooling can help reduce the number of instantiations by storing the objects in a pool and reusing them instead of creating new ones every time. \n\nHere's a basic implementation of what object pooling might look like:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject objectToPool;\n    public int poolSize;\n    private List<GameObject> pool;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectToPool);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pool.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pool.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                return pool[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can then modify your `ARInteractorSpawnTrigger` script to use this pool instead of creating a new object every frame:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public ObjectPool objectPool;\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n        {\n            m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n            var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n            if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n            {\n                if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                    return;\n\n                if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                    return;\n\n                GameObject spawnedObject = objectPool.GetPooledObject();\n                if (spawnedObject)\n                {\n                    spawnedObject.transform.position = arRaycastHit.pose.position;\n                    spawnedObject.transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(arPlane.normal);\n                    spawnedObject.SetActive(true);\n                }\n            }\n\n            return;\n        }\n        // rest of your code...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will enable you to reuse the same object instance for each spawn call instead of every frame creating a new one, which will reduce memory usage and increase performance.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you are trying to optimize the code by moving instantiation operation to a different part of the code, such as in `Awake` or `Start` method. This is a common optimization technique in Unity where you avoid or minimize usage of expensive operations like instantiation in the `Update` method.\n\nHowever, in order to provide the most accurate code, I need to understand more context about the application and how this object is being used.\n\nHere's the refactored code:\n\n```csharp\n\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ObjectSpawner : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ... other code ...\n\n    private GameObject m_SpawnVisualizationPrefabInstance;\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        if (m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab != null)\n        {\n            m_SpawnVisualizationPrefabInstance = Instantiate(m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab, transform);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... other code ...\n}\n```\nIn the above code, a new instance of `m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab` is created and attached to the same GameObject as where this `ObjectSpawner` script is attached. This setup is common for spawning objects that are visual only and should not be destroyed with the object they are visualized with.\n\nRemember to set `m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab` as `null` or a suitable prefab in the inspector if you don't want to spawn any visualization every time.\n\nIf you want to move instantiation towards the beginning of the game and not every frame when a user interacts with the application, you might want to consider using object pooling. Object pooling is a design pattern for reusing expensive objects. It is a specialized form of the object cache where reusable objects are stored so that they may be quickly be resurrected and delivered to the requester. It is used to decrease the performance impact of spawning new objects.",
    "code_repairing_3": "* In order to improve the efficiency of your code, you can use an object pooling system. An object pool is a pre-allocated set of instantiated game objects that can be reused in Unity. By doing this, you can avoid expensive instantiation and garbage collection, which is a common cause of performance issues in game development. Here's an example of how you can implement it:\n* \n* First, you will need to create an ObjectPool prefab that includes a pooling component. This prefab should include a game object pool that will store the objects that will be reused. In the game object pool, you should add the game objects that will be reused.\n* \n* For the pooling component, you can use the following code:\n* \n* ```csharp\n* using System.Collections.Generic;\n* using UnityEngine;\n* \n* public class Pooler : MonoBehaviour\n* {\n*     public GameObject pooledObject;\n*     public int pooledAmount;\n*     public bool willGrow;\n* \n*     private List<GameObject> pooledObjects;\n* \n*     void Start()\n*     {\n*         pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n*         for (int i = 0; i < pooledAmount; i++)\n*         {\n*             GameObject obj = (GameObject)Instantiate(pooledObject);\n*             obj.SetActive(false);\n*             pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n*         }\n*     }\n* \n*     public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n*     {\n*         for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++)\n*         {\n*             if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy)\n*             {\n*                 return pooledObjects[i];\n*             }\n*         }\n* \n*         if (willGrow)\n*         {\n*             GameObject obj = (GameObject)Instantiate(pooledObject);\n*             pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n*             return obj;\n*         }\n* \n*         return null;\n*     }\n* }\n* ```\n* \n* In your `ARInteractorSpawnTrigger` class, you should replace the `Instantiate()` calls with calls to the `GetPooledObject()` method of your pool:\n* \n* ```csharp\n* public class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n* {\n*     public Pooler myPool; // Assign your ObjectPooler in the inspector\n* \n*     void Update()\n*     {\n*         if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n*         {\n*             m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n*             // ... existing code\n*             m_ObjectSpawner = myPool.GetPooledObject();\n*             // ... rest of the code\n*         }\n*     }\n* }\n* ```\n* \n* This way, the `Instantiate()` method will not be called every frame, improving the efficiency of your game.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Here is the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    [SerializeField]\n    GameObject m_PooledObjectPrefab;\n\n    [SerializeField]\n    int m_InitialPoolSize;\n\n    List<GameObject> m_Pool;\n    GameObject m_Container;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        m_Pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        m_Container = new GameObject(\"ObjectPool\");\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < m_InitialPoolSize; i++)\n        {\n            AddObjectToPool();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void AddObjectToPool()\n    {\n        GameObject newObject = Instantiate(m_PooledObjectPrefab);\n        newObject.transform.SetParent(m_Container.transform);\n        newObject.SetActive(false);\n        m_Pool.Add(newObject);\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < m_Pool.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!m_Pool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                return m_Pool[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        // If no inactive objects, then add more to the pool.\n        AddObjectToPool();\n        return m_Pool[m_Pool.Count - 1];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the ARInteractorSpawnTrigger class, you would replace the line `m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);` with `m_ObjectSpawner.GetPooledObject().TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);`.\n\nHere I used an ObjectPool instead of instantiating objects in the Update() method. It will hold a fixed number of objects in the beginning which can be reused during runtime. If all objects are in use and a new one is needed, another object is created and added to the pool. This should be more efficient as compared to instantiating objects every frame."
