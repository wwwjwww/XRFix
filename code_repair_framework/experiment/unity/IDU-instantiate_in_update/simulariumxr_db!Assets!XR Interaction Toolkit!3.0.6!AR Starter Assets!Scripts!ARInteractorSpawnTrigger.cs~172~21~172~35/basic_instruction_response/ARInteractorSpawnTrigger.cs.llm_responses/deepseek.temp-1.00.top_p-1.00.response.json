    "code_repairing_0": "Sure, in a real-world application, you should never call Instantiate in the Update method, especially if it's used from a component like this one. The Update method is called at the frequency of the physics steps, and the frequency of physics steps could be high and you might face performance issues.\n\nInstead, you should call Instantiate in an appropriate event handler. Here is a suggestion to call Instantiate in the ObjectSpawner class when the TrySpawnObject method is called.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```csharp\npublic bool TrySpawnObject(Vector3 spawnPoint, Vector3 spawnNormal)\n{\n    if (transform.childCount > 0)\n    {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    if (m_OnlySpawnInView)\n    {\n        var inViewMin = m_ViewportPeriphery;\n        var inViewMax = 1f - m_ViewportPeriphery;\n        var pointInViewportSpace = cameraToFace.WorldToViewportPoint(spawnPoint);\n        if (pointInViewportSpace.z < 0f || pointInViewportSpace.x > inViewMax || pointInViewportSpace.x < inViewMin ||\n            pointInViewportSpace.y > inViewMax || pointInViewportSpace.y < inViewMin)\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    var objectIndex = isSpawnOptionRandomized ? Random.Range(0, m_ObjectPrefabs.Count) : m_SpawnOptionIndex;\n    SpawnObject(spawnPoint, spawnNormal, objectIndex);\n    return true;\n}\n\nvoid SpawnObject(Vector3 spawnPoint, Vector3 spawnNormal, int objectIndex)\n{\n    var newObject = Instantiate(m_ObjectPrefabs[objectIndex]);\n    if (m_SpawnAsChildren)\n        newObject.transform.parent = transform;\n\n    newObject.transform.position = spawnPoint;\n    EnsureFacingCamera();\n\n    var facePosition = m_CameraToFace.transform.position;\n    var forward = facePosition - spawnPoint;\n    BurstMathUtility.ProjectOnPlane(forward, spawnNormal, out var projectedForward);\n    newObject.transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(projectedForward, spawnNormal);\n\n    if (m_ApplyRandomAngleAtSpawn)\n    {\n        var randomRotation = Random.Range(-m_SpawnAngleRange, m_SpawnAngleRange);\n        newObject.transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, randomRotation);\n    }\n\n    if (m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab != null)\n    {\n        var visualizationTrans = Instantiate(m_SpawnVisualizationPrefab).transform;\n        visualizationTrans.position = spawnPoint;\n        visualizationTrans.rotation = newObject.transform.rotation;\n    }\n\n    objectSpawned?.Invoke(newObject);\n}\n```\n\nNow, when you want to spawn an object, you can just call the TrySpawnObject method. This method will take care of the rest.\n\nPlease note that these changes should be made considering all the places where TrySpawnObject is used, you may have to adjust it accordingly.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The issue with the code is that it's calling Instantiate each frame in the Update method, which is inefficient and can cause performance issues. Instantiate is a heavy operation and should be minimized. \n\nOne way to fix this would be to spawn the object when a trigger condition is met. Instead of relying on the Update method, use other Unity events such as OnTriggerEnter or Awake to spawn the object. Here is an example of how to modify your code:\n\n```C#\nusing System;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.StarterAssets;\n\nnamespace UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.ARStarterAssets\n{\n    public class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        // Existing code...\n\n        bool m_AttemptSpawn;\n        bool m_EverHadSelection;\n\n        // Added for spawning in Awake\n        void Awake()\n        {\n            if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n            {\n                m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n                var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem\n}",
    "code_repairing_2": "```csharp\n        public bool TrySpawnObject(Vector3 spawnPoint, Vector3 spawnNormal)\n        {\n            if (transform.childCount > 0)\n            {\n                return false;\n            }\n            \n            if (m_OnlySpawnInView)\n            {\n                var inViewMin = m_ViewportPeriphery;\n                var inViewMax = 1f - m_ViewportPeriphery;\n                var pointInViewportSpace = cameraToFace.WorldToViewportPoint(spawnPoint);\n                if (pointInViewportSpace.z < 0f || pointInViewportSpace.x > inViewMax || pointInViewportSpace.x < inViewMin ||\n                    pointInViewportSpace.y > inViewMax || pointInViewportSpace.y < inViewMin)\n                {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n\n            var objectIndex = isSpawnOptionRandomized ?

This issue was resolved by altering the code to only instantiate new objects when the `m_AttemptSpawn` flag is set. This allows the interactor to control when new objects are spawned.",
    "code_repairing_3": "There are a couple of ways to approach this. One option would be to move the instantiation logic to a separate method that can be called from both the Start() and Update() methods. Here's an example on how to do this:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n    {\n        m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n        SpawnObject();\n    }\n\n    // Rest of your code...\n}\n\nvoid SpawnObject()\n{\n    var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n    if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n    {\n        if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n            return;\n\n        if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n            return;\n\n        m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this approach, the instantiation is moved to a separate method `SpawnObject()`. This way, you are only calling the instantiation when it is necessary, which is a more efficient way compared to calling it in every frame. Also, it makes it easier to read and understand the code.\n\nPlease replace the update method with the fixed one and check if the rest of your code does not break as a result of this fix.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The bug in the code is that the Instantiate method is called in the Update method, which means it gets called every frame. This is not only inefficient, but also means that the spawned objects aren't guaranteed to be instantiated at the exact moment the Update method is called. If the object needs to be instantiated at a particular moment, it should be done in the appropriate place, not in the Update method.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n    {\n        m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n        var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n        if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n        {\n            if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                return;\n\n            if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                return;\n\n            // Spawn object is moved to fixed interval to reduce the frequency of instantiation.\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var selectState = m_ARInteractor.logicalSelectState;\n\n    if (m_BlockSpawnWhenInteractorHasSelection)\n    {\n        if (selectState.wasPerformedThisFrame)\n            m_EverHadSelection = m_ARInteractor.hasSelection;\n        else if (selectState.active)\n            m_EverHadSelection |= m_ARInteractor.hasSelection;\n    }\n\n    m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n    switch (m_SpawnTriggerType)\n    {\n        case SpawnTriggerType.SelectAttempt:\n            if (selectState.wasCompletedThisFrame)\n                m_AttemptSpawn = !m_ARInteractor.hasSelection && !m_EverHadSelection;\n            break;\n\n        case SpawnTriggerType.InputAction:\n            if (m_SpawnObjectInput.ReadWasPerformedThisFrame())\n                m_AttemptSpawn = !m_ARInteractor.hasSelection && !m_EverHadSelection;\n            break;\n    }\n}\n\n// Fixed the code for spawning an object in a fixed interval\nIEnumerator FixedUpdate()\n{\n    if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n    {\n        m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n        var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n        if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n        {\n            if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                return null;\n\n            if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                return null;\n\n            m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n        }\n\n        yield return null;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis change ensures that the object is instantiated only when the attempt to spawn is triggered, and it gets instantiated in a set fixed interval instead of every frame."
