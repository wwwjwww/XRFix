    "code_repairing_0": "Sure, it's a good practice to optimize code and avoid expensive operations, such as instantiating objects within the Update method. Instead, you can build an object pool before the Update method has been called and reuse the objects throughout the whole period.\n\nHere's a simple way to implement object pooling:\n\n```csharp\npublic class DebugUIHandlerCanvas : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    [...]\n    private List<GameObject> m_PooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n    private int m_PoolSize = 10;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        // Create initial pool\n        for (int i = 0; i < m_PoolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false);\n            m_PooledObjects.Add(obj);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Rebuild()\n    {\n        [...]\n        foreach (var panel in panels)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = GetPooledObject();\n            if (obj == null)\n            {\n                // If no pooled object can be found, create a new one\n                obj = Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false);\n                m_PooledObjects.Add(obj);\n            }\n\n            [... setup object here ...]\n\n            obj.SetActive(true);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < m_PooledObjects.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!m_PooledObjects[i].activeSelf)\n            {\n                return m_PooledObjects[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, we are creating an object pool of `panelPrefab` during the game's start. These objects are disabled (`obj.SetActive(false)`) and stored in `m_PooledObjects`. When `Rebuild()` is called, we look for a disabled object in the pool and use it instead of creating a new one. If no such object can be found, a new one is created.\n\nThis way, the number of instantiated objects in the scene is limited and doesn't grow without control, which could slow down your game if the pool size is too large. The trade-off is that more memory is consumed by the pool, but it's beneficial for performance if you are instantiating a lot of objects in the Update method.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The update method is called once per frame, which means it will make use of resources even during periods of time when no updates are required. This can be inefficient as the code suggests instantiating an object every frame. Instead, you should consider rebuilding your hierarchy in a more time-efficient manner whenever necessary, for example, when the state of the debug tree changes or when the panel selection changes.\n\nHere is an example of how you could modify your code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    int state = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n    if (m_DebugTreeState != state)\n    {\n        ResetAllHierarchy();\n    }\n\n    HandleInput();\n\n    int selectedPanel = DebugManager.instance.selectedPanel;\n    if (m_SelectedPanel != selectedPanel)\n    {\n        ActivatePanel(selectedPanel);\n    }\n\n    if (m_UIPanels != null && m_SelectedPanel < m_UIPanels.Count && m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel] != null)\n        m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel].UpdateScroll();\n}\n\nvoid ResetAllHierarchy()\n{\n    foreach (Transform t in transform)\n        CoreUtils.Destroy(t.gameObject);\n\n    m_UIPanels.Clear();\n    m_SelectedWidget = null;\n    m_CurrentQueryPath = \"\";\n    m_DebugTreeState = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n    var panels = DebugManager.instance.panels;\n\n    Rebuild(panels);\n}\n\nvoid Rebuild(List<DebugUIPanel> panels)\n{\n    m_PrefabsMap.Clear();\n    foreach (var bundle in prefabs)\n    {\n        var type = Type.GetType(bundle.type);\n\n        if (type != null && bundle.prefab != null)\n            m_PrefabsMap.Add(type, bundle.prefab);\n    }\n\n    foreach (var panel in panels)\n    {\n        if (panel.isEditorOnly || panel.children.Count(x => !x.isEditorOnly && !x.isHidden) == 0)\n            continue;\n\n        var go = Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false).gameObject;\n        go.name = panel.displayName;\n\n        var uiPanel = go.GetComponent<DebugUIHandlerPanel>();\n        uiPanel.SetPanel(panel);\n        uiPanel.Canvas = this;\n        m_UIPanels.Add(uiPanel);\n        var container = go.GetComponent<DebugUIHandlerContainer>();\n        DebugUIHandlerWidget selected = null;\n        Traverse(panel, container.contentHolder, null, ref selected);\n\n        if (selected != null && selected.GetWidget().queryPath.Contains(panel.queryPath))\n        {\n            m_SelectedWidget = selected.GetWidget();\n            m_CurrentQueryPath = panel.queryPath;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid ActivatePanel(int panelIndex)\n{\n    if (panelIndex < 0 || panelIndex >= m_UIPanels.Count)\n        return;\n\n    m_SelectedPanel = panelIndex;\n    for (int i = 0; i < m_UIPanels.Count; i++)\n    {\n        m_UIPanels[i].gameObject.SetActive(i == panelIndex);\n    }\n\n    if (m_SelectedWidget != null && m_SelectedWidget.queryPath == m_CurrentQueryPath)\n    {\n        m_SelectedWidget.OnShow();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this updated code, the Rebuild method now accepts a list of panels to avoid having to check the DebugManager instance every frame. The hierarchy is not reset on every frame, but rather when the state of the debug tree changes or when the panel selection changes. Furthermore, the selected panel is activated and deactivated using gameObject.SetActive, which is more efficient than destroying and recreating GameObjects. This reduces the number of context-switching operations that the CPU needs to perform.",
    "code_repairing_2": "From the given code, it seems like the bug is in the instantiation of game objects in the Update() method. This can be a performance issue as the Instantiate() method in Unity is relatively slow. If this method is called every frame, it can indeed lead to a performance drop. Therefore, it's recommended to move this instantiation to other parts of the code, either when the script is first initialized or in a separate method, like OnEnable() or Start().\n\nHere is your code with the Update() method changed to call a new method, OnStartOrUpdate, which carries out the necessary functionality:\n\n```C#\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine.Rendering;\n\nnamespace UnityEngine.Rendering.UI\n{\n    [Serializable]\n    public class DebugUIPrefabBundle\n    {\n        public string type;\n        public RectTransform prefab;\n    }\n\n    public class DebugUIHandlerCanvas : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        int m_DebugTreeState;\n        Dictionary<Type, Transform> m_PrefabsMap;\n        public Transform panelPrefab;\n        public List<DebugUIPrefabBundle> prefabs;\n        List<DebugUIHandlerPanel> m_UIPanels;\n        int m_SelectedPanel;\n        DebugUIHandlerWidget m_SelectedWidget;\n        string m_CurrentQueryPath;\n\n        void OnEnable()\n        {\n            if (prefabs == null)\n                prefabs = new List<DebugUIPrefabBundle>();\n\n            if (m_PrefabsMap == null)\n                m_PrefabsMap = new Dictionary<Type, Transform>();\n\n            if (m_UIPanels == null)\n                m_UIPanels = new List<DebugUIHandlerPanel>();\n\n            DebugManager.instance.RegisterRootCanvas(this);\n        }\n\n        void Start()\n        {\n            OnStartOrUpdate();\n        }\n\n        void Update()\n        {\n            OnStartOrUpdate();\n        }\n\n        internal void OnStartOrUpdate()\n        {\n            int state = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n            if (m_DebugTreeState != state)\n            {\n                ResetAllHierarchy();\n            }\n\n            HandleInput();\n\n            if (m_UIPanels != null && m_SelectedPanel < m_UIPanels.Count && m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel] != null)\n                m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel].UpdateScroll();\n        }\n\n        //... Rest of your code\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this change is based on the assumption that the functionality in OnStartOrUpdate is equivalent to the Update method's functionality. If there is any difference, this solution might not work. If so, you might need to adjust accordingly.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The inefficiency of instantiating prefabs in the Update method is noticeable, especially for games running at high frame rates. This could lead to a noticeable delay and can affect the game's performance. In Unity, you should use the Instantiate method in FixedUpdate if you're attempting to instantiate objects. The FixedUpdate method is called at a fixed interval (default is 0.02 seconds), independent of frame rate. This aligns more closely with the concept of physics.\n\nHere's how you could refactor your code to use FixedUpdate instead of Update:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing UnityEngine.Rendering;\n\nnamespace UnityEngine.Rendering.UI\n{\n    [Serializable]\n    public class DebugUIPrefabBundle\n    {\n        public string type;\n        public RectTransform prefab;\n    }\n\n    public class DebugUIHandlerCanvas : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        int m_DebugTreeState;\n        Dictionary<Type, Transform> m_PrefabsMap;\n\n        public Transform panelPrefab;\n        public List<DebugUIPrefabBundle> prefabs;\n        List<DebugUIHandlerPanel> m_UIPanels;\n        int m_SelectedPanel;\n        DebugUIHandlerWidget m_SelectedWidget;\n        string m_CurrentQueryPath;\n\n        void OnEnable()\n        {\n            if (prefabs == null)\n                prefabs = new List<DebugUIPrefabBundle>();\n\n            if (m_PrefabsMap == null)\n                m_PrefabsMap = new Dictionary<Type, Transform>();\n\n            if (m_UIPanels == null)\n                m_UIPanels = new List<DebugUIHandlerPanel>();\n\n            DebugManager.instance.RegisterRootCanvas(this);\n        }\n\n        void FixedUpdate()\n        {\n            int state = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n            if (m_DebugTreeState != state)\n            {\n                ResetAllHierarchy();\n            }\n\n            HandleInput();\n\n            if (m_UIPanels != null && m_SelectedPanel < m_UIPanels.Count && m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel] != null)\n                m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel].UpdateScroll();\n        }\n\n        internal void RequestHierarchyReset()\n        {\n            m_DebugTreeState = -1;\n        // Rest of your code...\n```\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the prefabs instantiated in FixedUpdate might not be instantiated exactly where you want them in the hierarchy. FixedUpdate is called at a fixed frequency, so you might need to manually adjust their positions based on your game's logic.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The problem with the buggy code is the `Instantiate()` function being called inside the `Update()` method, which results in unnecessary memory allocations and garbage collection at each frame. The more frequent the `Update()` method is called, the more resources it uses. \n\nTo fix this issue, you can move the `Instantiate()` function outside of the `Update()` method. This way, the instantiation happens only when the `Rebuild()` method is called, which is less frequent in comparison.\n\nAlso, you need to ensure that if the `ResetAllHierarchy()` method is called, it clears the object pool. This way, objects that were instantiated don't stay in memory indefinitely.\n\nThis is a basic example of how you can implement object pooling in your code. This is simplified and you may need to customize it to fit your specific needs.\n\n```csharp\nprivate List<GameObject> instancePool = new List<GameObject>();\n\npublic GameObject InstantiateFromPool(Transform prefab, Transform parent, bool worldPositionStays = false)\n{\n    GameObject result = instancePool.Find(x => !x.activeSelf);\n\n    if (result == null)\n    {\n        result = Instantiate(prefab, parent, worldPositionStays).gameObject;\n        instancePool.Add(result);\n    }\n\n    result.SetActive(true);\n    return result;\n}\n\npublic void ResetPool()\n{\n    foreach (GameObject obj in instancePool)\n    {\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith the `InstantiateFromPool()` function, you replace `Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false).gameObject` with `InstantiateFromPool(panelPrefab, transform, false)` inside your `Rebuild()` method. After returning objects to the pool, you can call `ResetPool()` in your `ResetAllHierarchy()` method."
