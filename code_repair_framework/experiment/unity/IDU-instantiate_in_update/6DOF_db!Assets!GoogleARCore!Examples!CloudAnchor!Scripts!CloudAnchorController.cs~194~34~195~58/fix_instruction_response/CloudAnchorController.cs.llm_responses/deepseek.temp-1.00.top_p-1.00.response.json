    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you've implemented an object instantiation inside the Update method, which is not ideal from performance perspective. Instead, you can instantiate your object before it gets placed on an AR anchor. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact scenario or requirements, it's hard to provide a precise solution. If your instantiation is causing performance issues, or if you're encountering issues with memory usage, consider using an object pooling system. Object pooling is a design pattern that avoids costly instantiations during gameplay and improves performance. \n\nFor instance, you can create a pool of Andy objects and have them ready to instantiate whenever a touch event occurs. This way, you avoid instantiating multiple objects at once and also save memory.\n\nHere's a rough example of how you can implement object pooling in Unity:\n\n```csharp\npublic class AndyObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject AndyPrefab;\n    private Queue<GameObject> AndyPool;\n    public int AndyPoolSize = 5;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        AndyPool = new Queue<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < AndyPoolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject Andy = Instantiate(AndyPrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);\n            Andy.SetActive(false);\n            AndyPool.Enqueue(Andy);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetAndy()\n    {\n        GameObject Andy = AndyPool.Dequeue();\n        Andy.SetActive(true);\n        AndyPool.Enqueue(Andy);\n        return Andy;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can assign this script to an empty GameObject in your scene, where you set the `AndyPrefab` as the Andy model you want to pool. Then, when a touch event occurs and you need to instantiate an Andy object, you call `GetAndy()`, which returns an inactive Andy object from the pool.\n\nRemember to always activate / deactivate objects using `SetActive(true/false)` to reuse them in the pool.\n\nThis way, you avoid the overhead of instantiating and destroying objects and should have better performance.",
    "code_repairing_1": "```csharp\nprivate ObjectPool m_AndyPool;\n\npublic void Start()\n{\n    m_AndyPool = new ObjectPool(ARCoreAndyAndroidPrefab); // Assuming ARCoreAndyAndroidPrefab is the prefab of Andy.\n\n    // rest of the script\n}\n\npublic void Update()\n{\n    // rest of the script\n    \n    if (m_LastPlacedAnchor != null)\n    {\n        var andyObject = m_AndyPool.GetNextObject(m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position, \n            m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n        \n        andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n        andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n        _HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe issue with using `Instantiate()` in the `Update()` method is that it's called each frame, which can be too frequent for your needs. Using an object pool can ensure that `Instantiate()` is only called when necessary, reducing the load time of the game and improving performance. \n\nIn this example, we setup an object pool in the `Start()` method, and use the pool's `GetNextObject()` method to instantiate the Andy object in the `Update()` method. This way, we only instantiate Andy once per frame, rather than every frame.",
    "code_repairing_2": "In Unity, the `Instantiate()` method is meant to be used in the `Start()` method or wherever you initialize your game objects to prevent calling it in each frame. If you are calling `Instantiate()` in the `Update()` method, it might be causing inefficiencies and performance issues.\n\nIt's hard to tell what your issue is specific without additional context about your game design or project structure, but here's a basic example of how you could implement object pooling with a `Start()` method:\n\n```C#\npublic GameObject AndyPrefab;\npublic int InitialPoolSize;\nprivate Queue<GameObject> andyPool;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    andyPool = new Queue<GameObject>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < InitialPoolSize; i++)\n    {\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(AndyPrefab);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        andyPool.Enqueue(obj);\n    }\n}\n\npublic GameObject GetAndyObject()\n{\n    if (andyPool.Count > 0)\n    {\n        return andyPool.Dequeue();\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return Instantiate(AndyPrefab);\n    }\n}\n\npublic void ReturnAndyObject(GameObject obj)\n{\n    obj.SetActive(false);\n    andyPool.Enqueue(obj);\n}\n```\n\nYou can use this by calling `GetAndyObject()` when you want to get an Andy object and `ReturnAndyObject(obj)` when you want to return it back to the pool. This way you don't have to call `Instantiate()` every frame, reducing unnecessary memory usage and potentially improving game performance.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code has several potential issues:\n\n1. **Instantiating in Update method**\n\n   The `Instantiate()` function is generally called outside of the `Update()` function to ensure that changes aren't being made during every frame, which can lead to unoptimized performance. I suggest moving instantiation to a `Start()` function, or to a separate method that's called when a new anchor is created.\n\n   Correct Code:\n   ```csharp\n   public class CloudAnchorController : MonoBehaviour\n   {\n       // ...\n       private GameObject andyObject;\n\n       private void Start()\n       {\n           andyObject = Instantiate(GetAndyPrefab(), transform.position, transform.rotation);\n           andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n           andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n       }\n\n       private GameObject GetAndyPrefab()\n       {\n           // Implement your logic here to get the correct prefab\n           // ...\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Performance issue with Instantiate**\n\n   When instantiating objects, especially when those objects are complex (like in your case), it may slow down your program. To avoid this, you could consider using object pooling, which is a design pattern that allows you to reuse objects instead of creating new ones each time you need them.\n\n   However, without knowing how your program is structured, it's hard to provide a more specific solution. If you are using object pools, make sure to properly set up and manage your pools in your application.\n\n   Refer to https://unity3d.com/how-to/object-pooling for more information.\n\n3. **Using ARCore and ARKit**\n\n   In your code, you are enabling/disabling ARCore and ARKit based on the platform. It's good practice to only enable one of them and use the other for Android. You are enabling ARCore for platforms other than iPhone and ARKit for iPhone. This is unnecessary inconsistent approach.\n\n   So, you can enable ARCore and ARKit for Android and make ARKit work only for iPhone.\n\nLastly, but most importantly, remember that resolving an anchor (getting the anchor to world-known state) can be a very slow operation, especially over Wi-Fi networks. So, you have to be prepared to handle this delay and give feedback to the user about the operation in progress.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It appears you are trying to optimize your code by avoiding the cost of instantiating objects in the Update() method, which is resource-intensive. This is especially true if you are doing this every frame. An alternative approach is to make use of object pools to reuse these objects rather than instantiating them every frame.\n\nAn object pool is a collection of objects that can be instantiated and reused. Instead of creating a new object every time, the object pool allows you to reuse existing objects, which can significantly reduce the number of objects being created and destroyed, thus improving performance.\n\nHowever, you need to understand that if your game logic requires the object to be instantiated at certain points, you will have to modify the object pool to handle these cases when needed.\n\nHere's a simplified way to handle object pooling in C#:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int poolSize;\n\n    private GameObject[] pool;\n    private int currentIndex;\n\n    public void Start()\n    {\n        pool = new GameObject[poolSize];\n        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n        {\n            pool[i] = Instantiate(prefab);\n            pool[i].SetActive(false);\n        }\n\n        currentIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetObject()\n    {\n        GameObject obj = pool[currentIndex];\n        currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % poolSize;\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn your `CloudAnchorController` script, you could use this object pool like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic ObjectPool objectPool; // Assign this in the inspector\n\n// Then whenever you need to create a new object:\nGameObject newObject = objectPool.GetObject();\n\nnewObject.transform.position = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position;\nnewObject.transform.rotation = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation;\n```\n\nThis way, instead of creating a new `GameObject` every frame, you get one from the object pool that's not being used, and you can reuse it each time you need to instantiate a new object. This reduces the number of objects being created and destroyed, which can improve performance."
