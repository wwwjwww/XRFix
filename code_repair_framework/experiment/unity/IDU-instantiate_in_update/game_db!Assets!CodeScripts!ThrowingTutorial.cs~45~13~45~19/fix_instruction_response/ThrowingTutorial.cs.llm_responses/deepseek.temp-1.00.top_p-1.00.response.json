    "code_repairing_0": "The issue with your code is that you are using `Instantiate()` to create the thrown object inside the `Update()` method, which is called every frame. This is highly inefficient and will consume a lot of processing power, particularly in situations where the game is running at high frame rates. The solution would be to move the object instantiation to the `Start()` method or at an appropriate place in your game sequence.\n\nFrom your question, it seems like you're using object pools to manage your thrown objects. Object pools are a good way to avoid this performance problem. An object pool is a collection of pre-instantiated game object that you can activate or deactivate when they are needed. This way, you don't need to constantly instantiate and destroy objects, which can greatly improve performance.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n1. Create a new script called `ObjectPooler`:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ObjectPooler : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject pooledObject;\n    public int pooledAmount;\n    List<GameObject> pooledObjects;\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledAmount; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(pooledObject);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy)\n            {\n                return pooledObjects[i];\n            }\n        }\n        // if there are no inactive objects in the pool, we instantiate a new one\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(pooledObject);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Attach this script to an empty GameObject in your scene, and set `pooledObject` to `objectToThrow` and `pooledAmount` to the number of objects you want to pool.\n\n3. Modify your `Throw` method to get the object from the pool:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    readyToThrow = false;\n\n    GameObject thrownObject = pooler.GetPooledObject();\n    Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n    rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n    thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n    thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n    thrownObject.SetActive(true); // activate the object before using it, to avoid activating it at frame 0\n\n    throwCounter++;\n\n    if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        armorObject.SetActive(false); \n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n        swordObject.SetActive(true); \n    }\n\n    totalThrows--;\n\n    Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n}\n```\n\nYou'll also need to add a reference to your `ObjectPooler` script in the inspector, named `pooler`.\n\nThis way, your `Throw` method only creates a new object when it can't find an inactive one in the pool, which is much more efficient than constantly instantiating and destroying objects.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The problem with your code is that you are instantiating the object in the `Update()` method, which is called every frame, which can lead to performance issues depending on the frequency at which this function is called. Instantiating an object in every frame can quickly use up the system's resources.\n\nHere is the revised code using an object pooling system:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject pooledObject;\n    public int pooledAmount;\n    private List<GameObject> pooledObjects;\n    \n    void Start()\n    {\n        pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledAmount; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(pooledObject);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy)\n                return pooledObjects[i];\n        }\n        \n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(pooledObject);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n\n// In your throwing script\npublic ObjectPool myObjectPool;\n\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    readyToThrow = false;\n    \n    if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n        GameObject thrownObject = myObjectPool.GetPooledObject();\n        thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n        thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n        thrownObject.SetActive(true);\n        Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n        rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n        throwCounter++;\n    }\n    else if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        armorObject.SetActive(false); \n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n        swordObject.SetActive(true); \n    }\n\n    totalThrows--; \n\n    Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n}\n```\n\nIn this way, we first create a pool of objects in the `Start` method before any frame is drawn. Then when we need to instantiate an object, we take one inactive object from the pool and activate it. This way, we avoid calling `Instantiate` in the `Update` method, which can lead to performance hits.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here is a refactored version of your code. I have created a function called ThrowObject that is called from the Update function and also from ResetThrow function.

Moreover, I also eliminated the problematic use of `Instantiate()` in the `Update()` method. I believe this is a much cleaner approach to your script.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Sure, you can implement a pooling system in Unity to handle your projectile instantiations. This can be done by creating a child GameObject for each projectile in the hierarchy and then destroying and reinstantiating them as needed instead of using Instantiate(). \n\nHere is a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```C#\npublic class ThrowingTutorial : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    //...\n\n    private GameObject[] projectilePool;\n    private int currentPoolIndex = 0;\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        // Create a pool of projectiles\n        projectilePool = new GameObject[totalThrows];\n        for (int i = 0; i < totalThrows; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectToThrow, attackPoint.position, attackPoint.rotation);\n            obj.SetActive(false); // Deactivate them all initially\n            projectilePool[i] = obj;\n        }\n\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        if (inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n        {\n            Throw();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Throw()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = false;\n\n        if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n        {\n            //...\n\n            // Enable next available pooled object\n            projectilePool[currentPoolIndex].SetActive(true);\n            //...\n\n            // Reset the position and rotation of the pooled object\n            projectilePool[currentPoolIndex].transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n            projectilePool[currentPoolIndex].transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n\n            // Get next index\n            currentPoolIndex = (currentPoolIndex + 1) % totalThrows;\n\n            //...\n\n            Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n        }\n    }\n\n    //...\n}\n```\nIn this code, we're creating a pool of projectiles and deactivating them all initially. Then, each time we need to throw a projectile, we activate the next available object in the pool, reset its position and rotation, and then deactivate it and get the next index. This way, we avoid the expensive Instantiate() and Destroy() calls.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class ThrowingTutorial : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    [Header(\"References\")]\n    public Transform cam;\n    public Transform attackPoint;\n    public GameObject objectToThrow;\n    public GameObject armorObject;\n    public GameObject swordObject;\n    public GameObject player;\n\n    [Header(\"Settings\")]\n    public int totalThrows;\n    public float throwCooldown; \n\n    [Header(\"Throwing\")]\n    public KeyCode throwKey = KeyCode.K;\n    public float throwForce;\n\n    bool readyToThrow;\n\n    private int throwCounter = 0; \n    private bool inCollider = false; \n\n    AudioManager audioManager;\n\n    //Create Object Pool before Update\n    private Queue<GameObject> objectPool;\n    private int poolSize = 10; //Set the desired pool size.\n\n    private void Awake()\n    {\n        audioManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\"Audio\").GetComponent<AudioManager>();\n        objectPool = new Queue<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectToThrow);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            objectPool.Enqueue(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n        {\n            Throw();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Throw()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = false;\n\n        if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n        {\n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n\n            GameObject thrownObject = objectPool.Dequeue();\n            thrownObject.SetActive(true);\n            thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n            thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n            Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n            rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n            throwCounter++;\n\n            objectPool.Enqueue(thrownObject); // Return object to pool\n        }\n        else if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n        {\n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n            armorObject.SetActive(false); \n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n            swordObject.SetActive(true); \n        }\n\n        totalThrows--;\n\n        Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n    }\n\n    private void ResetThrow()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the corrected code, an object pool is used to instantiate and deactivate `objectToThrow` prefabs instead of instantiating them in `Update()`. This reduces the performance impact of constantly instantiating and destroying GameObjects. The object pool consists of 10 GameObjects (you can change this to your desired size). When throwing is ready, the pooled GameObject is set to active and has its position and rotation set to match the attackPoint. The thrown object is then added back to the pool. \n\nThis way, instantiation is moved out of `Update()`, potentially boosting performance. Also, the `ResetThrow()` method ensures `readyToThrow` is properly reset after the throw cooldown. \n\nPlease note that there can be more efficient ways to handle this depending on the specifics of your game. This is just one way to achieve the same effect."
