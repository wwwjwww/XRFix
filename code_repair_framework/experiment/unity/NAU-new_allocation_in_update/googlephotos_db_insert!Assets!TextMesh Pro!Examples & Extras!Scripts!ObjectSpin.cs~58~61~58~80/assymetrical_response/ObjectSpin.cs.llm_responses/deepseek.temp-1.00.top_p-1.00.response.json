This is done by reducing the `SpinSpeed` value by 0.99 every 60 frames.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Based on the full code given, it seems like the coder used the Unity Engine's MonoBehaviour class and wrote a script for objects to spin based on different motion types. These types are Rotation, BackAndForth, and Translation. \n\nIf the missing part of the code is not included, it's unclear what the next piece of code is intended to do. Are we supposed to complete the Translation motion code, or is the missing piece of the script just incomplete?\n\nIf you can provide more details or the missing part of the code, I'll be able to help you more accurately.",
