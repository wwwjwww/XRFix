    "code_repairing_0": "Your code is missing some parts that are necessary for the script to work as intended. I see that you have an incomplete if-else block for axes RotationAxes.MouseY and you are attempting to implement a rotation around X axis. \n\nHere is a complete version of your code with additional details:\n\n```C#\n    rotationY += Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") * sensitivityY;\n    rotationY = Mathf.Clamp (rotationY, minimumY, maximumY);\n\n    transform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, transform.localEulerAngles.y, 0);\n}\nelse \n{\n    transform.Rotate(Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") * sensitivityY, 0, 0);\n}\n```\n\nIn this script, a variable `rotationY` is used to track the current rotation in the Y-axis, updating it based on mouse movement. This rotation is then applied to the camera with `transform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, transform.localEulerAngles.y, 0);`\n\nIt should be noted that `transform.Rotate` is used here to apply a rotation to the camera. If you want the camera to rotate the player object, you would use `transform.Rotate` on the player object.\n\nPlease adjust the sensitivities, minimums, and maximums according to your specific requirements.",
    "code_repairing_1": "This script is a Unity C# script which controls the camera rotation in response to the mouse movements. It is a common script used in a lot of first person shooter type games to simulate a real looking movement of the camera. Here is a brief explanation of what each part does:\n\n- It starts by defining various enums for different types of axes along which it can rotate.\n\n- `sensitivityX` and `sensitivityY` variables adjust the speed of rotation.\n\n- `minimumX` and `maximumX` define the range of rotation on the X axis.\n\n- `minimumY` and `maximumY` define the range of rotation on the Y axis.\n\n- The `Update` function is where the actual rotation action happens. It reacts to the mouse movements and performs the rotation based on the `axes` variable.\n\n- If `axes` is set to `MouseXAndY`, the camera rotates on both X and Y axes.\n\n- If `axes` is set to `MouseX`, the camera only rotates on the X axis.\n\n- If `axes` is set to `MouseY`, the camera only rotates on the Y axis.\n\nYou may need to adjust these values depending on the desired behaviour of your camera. It is also important to note that this script should be attached to the camera object in your Unity scene.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code appears to be a Unity script for mouse-based camera rotation. It checks the `axes` enum value to determine how the camera should rotate based on the user's mouse input.\n\nHere's a brief breakdown of what your script does:\n\n1. It uses the `Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\")` and `Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\")` to get the mouse's x and y movement. \n\n2. It multiplies the input from the mouse by `sensitivityX` and `sensitivityY` to get the rotation values. \n\n3. Depending on the `axes` value, it either rotates the camera on the y-axis or on both the x and y axes.\n\n4. It uses `Mathf.Clamp()` to make sure the rotation doesn't exceed the `minimumY` and `maximumY` values set in the script.\n\n5. It then sets the rotation of the camera to the new rotation value. \n\nIf you have additional questions about this script or how it works, feel free to ask!",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code seems to be incomplete but here is how you can finish it:\n\n```csharp\n\t\t\ttransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, transform.localEulerAngles.y, 0);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tpublic static float ClampAngle (float angle, float min, float max)\n\t{\n\t\tif (angle < -360F)\n\t\t\tangle += 360F;\n\t\tif (angle > 360F)\n\t\t\tangle -= 360F;\n\t\treturn Mathf.Clamp (angle, min, max);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis script allows for rotation of the attached game object based on mouse input. The `axes` variable determines if rotation is only on X, only on Y, or both axes. `sensitivityX` and `sensitivityY` control the mouse speed of rotation. The `minimumX` and `maximumX` limit the rotation on the Y axis, and `minimumY` and `maximumY` limit the rotation on the X axis. The `ClampAngle` method ensures that the angles are within the given ranges.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Your script seems to be incomplete, and the last part seems to be cut off. The script is meant to handle the rotation of the camera based on mouse inputs. \n\nYou need to add the code to handle the rotation along the Y-axis and perhaps also constrain it within certain bounds.\n\n```csharp\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\trotationY += Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") * sensitivityY;\n\t\t\trotationY = Mathf.Clamp (rotationY, minimumY, maximumY);\n\n\t\t\ttransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, transform.localEulerAngles.y, 0);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nThis code will handle the rotation of the camera around the Y-axis according to the mouse Y input. It also clamps the rotation to the minimum and maximum values defined in the script. The rotation on the X-axis is left as is, according to the mouse X input. \n\nRemember to attach this script to the Camera object you intend to use for the mouse look in the Unity editor. The script is now complete and should work as expected, with the camera rotating as expected when attached to a Camera gameobject."
