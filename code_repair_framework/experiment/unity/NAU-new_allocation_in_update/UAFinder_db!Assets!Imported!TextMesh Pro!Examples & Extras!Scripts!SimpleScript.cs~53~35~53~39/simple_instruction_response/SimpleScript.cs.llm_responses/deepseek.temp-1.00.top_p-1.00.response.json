    "code_repairing_0": "The issue here is that the function `SetText()` is expecting 3 `float` arguments but it seems like you're passing in additional ones (`m_frame % 1000` and `1 * Time.deltaTime`) that are not required. You should replace these with the actual format specification (`%d` for integer, `%f` for float, etc.) that you need in the text string, and pass in the appropriate variables. \n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    int frame = (int) (m_frame % 1000);\n    float timeDelta = Time.deltaTime;\n\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, frame, timeDelta, timeDelta);\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we're passing `frame`, `timeDelta` and `timeDelta` as the arguments since the text string `label` seems to contain `%d` and `%f` placeholders. Please adjust this as per your actual use case.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Sure, I see that there are two issues in your code:\n\n1. In the 'SetText' function in '/Library/PackageCache/com.unity.textmeshpro@2.0.1/Scripts/Runtime/TMP_Text.cs', the function 'AddFloatToCharArray' is being called with incorrect parameters. The function expects a float value and an int reference, but in your code, it seems like you're passing the whole string as a float. You should pass the numerical part as a float.\n\n2. In 'Update' function in '/Assets/Imported/TextMesh Pro/Examples & Extras/Scripts/SimpleScript.cs', 'm_frame' variable is being multiplied by 'Time.deltaTime'. If you're trying to update 'm_frame' every frame, this might be desirable. If not, consider removing the multiplication to the 'm_frame'.\n\nPlease replace the lines with the corrected ones below:\n\n// Buggy code:\n//        m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, m_frame % 1000);\n// Fixed code:\nfloat frameNum = m_frame % 1000;\nm_textMeshPro.SetText(label, frameNum);        \n\nAnd\n\n// Buggy code:\n//        m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n// Fixed code:\nm_frame += Time.deltaTime;\n\nI hope this is helpful. If you have further issues, please provide more details.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here's the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    // The '123' and '58' are ASCII values for '{' and ':' respectively\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, m_frame % 1000, m_frame % 1000, m_frame % 1000);\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n```\n\nThis code will work assuming \"label\" is a string variable and \"m_frame\" is a float variable. It's sending the same frame value as arguments to the SetText function with \"m_frame % 1000\" as each argument. The \"%\" operator is used to limit the frame value to a maximum of 1000. If you want to modify the arguments, you can replace \"m_frame % 1000\" with the corresponding variables or calculations. \n\nIn addition, please make sure that the SetText function in the TMP_Text.cs file accepts three floats as parameters according to the given function definition. The parameters for the SetText function call in your code does not match this function signature in the TMP_Text.cs file. So, you might need to adjust your code to match the function signature in TMP_Text.cs file. If the SetText function does not accept three floats as parameters, you will need to modify the function definition or the function call in your code to match the actual parameters the function expects.",
    "code_repairing_3": "// Correct number of parameters should be passed to the SetText function. The corrected code should look like this:\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, Mathf.FloorToInt(m_frame % 1000), m_frame, m_frame);\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n\n// Here, we assume you meant to pass 3 arguments to SetText function which are the floored integer value of (m_frame % 1000), m_frame, and m_frame. \n// The number of parameters you pass to the function should match the number of arguments it expects. \n// This is important because it allows the function to correctly interpret the arguments. \n// In this case, it might be assumed you're replacing placeholder numbers with frame value, and that is why the arguments are m_frame, m_frame and floored int of m_frame.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    int frame = (int)(m_frame % 1000);\n\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, frame, m_frame, m_frame % 1000);\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem with the original code is that it is passing three separate arguments (three different values) to the `SetText` function of `TMP_Text`, but `SetText` in reality takes only one string parameter and can take 0 to 3 float parameters. \n\nIn this revised fixed code, I just pass one string and three float variables to the SetText function. The float variables are the frame, m_frame and the module of m_frame by 1000 (m_frame % 1000), so you'll get an updated value for every frame. The '+=' operator has been added to increment m_frame every frame, so you'll also have a 'frame clock' function."
