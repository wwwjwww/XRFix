I have corrected the code and included a brief explanation of the changes:

// private void Update()

    // Change: removed the timer logic and functionality to ensure efficiency

    if (loadSceneOnNextUpdate != null)
    {
        SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(loadSceneOnNextUpdate);
        loadSceneOnNextUpdate = null;
    }
}

public void Release(GameObject b2)
{
    if (b2)
    {
        Destroy(b2);
    }
}

//EXPLANATION:
The code uses Instantiate and Destroy in the Start method to instantiate a game object and then destroy it after a specified time. However, using Instantiate and Destroy in the Update method would be more efficient, as it can cause performance issues when executing them each frame
    public void Release(GameObject b2)
    {
        Destroy(b2);
    }
}
