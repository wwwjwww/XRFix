You can adjust the values of maxSpeed, acceleration, deceleration, and boost to get your desired behavior. \n\nPlease remember that this is just a rudimentary version of a player's movement. You need to implement the collision detection for the enemies and define what happens when the enemy collides with the bike (like decreasing the speed, stopping the game, etc.).",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your code seems to be missing a closing brace `}` which will lead to compilation errors. I'm assuming you meant for the `Update()` method to have the missing brace, here's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class Player : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject cameraRig;\n    public GameObject bike;\n\n    public float speed = 0f;\n    public float maxSpeed = 50f;\n\n    public float acceleration = 0.05f;  // Triggered every second \n    public float deceleration = 0.5f;   // Triggered upon jump\n    public float boost = 0.25f;         // Triggered upon enemyHit  \n\n    public bool reachedFinishLine = false;\n\n    public int score = 0;    //Score for each enemy hit\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        cameraRig = GameObject.Find(\"CameraRig\");   //Import CameraRig (Parent of the VR Camera)\n        bike = GameObject.Find(\"Bike\");  //Import the bike \n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        speed += acceleration * Time.deltaTime;\n        if (speed > maxSpeed) {\n            speed = maxSpeed;   // Setting a max speed \n        }\n\n        Vector3 direction = new Vector3( transform.forward.x, 0,  transform.forward.z); \n        \n        cameraRig.transform.position +=  direction.normalized * speed *  Time.deltaTime;\n\n        // The rest of your code goes here...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation of what you wrote. To have the full functionality, you also need to implement the rest of the code where it says `// The rest of your code goes here...`. Depending on your game's requirements, you will need to add more elements to this, which will depend on your specific use-case and game mechanics.",

If the player presses the \"Fire1\" or \"space\", the player's speed reduces by deceleration. The speed limit is maxSpeed. I've made sure the player's bike moves along with the player, and the player can only move left or right within the specified area. If the bike collides with an obstacle, the score will be increased. Please replace the collision part with your own logic, or add the related function in the Player class. \n\nAlso, it's crucial to ensure the Player and Bike tags are added to the corresponding GameObjects in your Unity editor. You will need them in your `OnCollisionEnter()` or similar methods to recognize when the bike hits an obstacle. \n\nPlease note that this is a basic implementation and it may not cover all your needs. You will probably need to further adjust it depending on your game mechanics.",

Make sure you correctly align the objects in your scene by checking their rotation and position in Unity Inspector or by using Transform.rotation and Transform.position."
