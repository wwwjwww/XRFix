    "code_repairing_0": "The issue is with the Update method in the DistanceGrabber script. As per Unity's physics engine, objects should be moved in the FixedUpdate method. This is because physics simulations are executed in fixed time intervals (like Physics.fixedDeltaTime). Transforming or changing properties of a Rigidbody in Update method would not guarantee the accurate simulation. \n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid FixedUpdate()\n{\n    if (m_operatingWithoutOVRCameraRig)\n    {\n        OnUpdatedAnchors();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis change will ensure that the Rigidbody is moved in the FixedUpdate method, which is the correct place to update physics based positions and rotations. Now, the error associated with the Transform of Rigidbody should be resolved.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Rigidbody transformations should be done in FixedUpdate() methods to simulate real-world movement. The reason is that physics simulations are run under FixedUpdate(), which has fixed time intervals, unlike Update() that has a variable time interval based on the frame rate of the game. So, the results from physics update can affect the stability of the gameplay.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```C#\nprivate void FixedUpdate()\n{\n    if (m_operatingWithoutOVRCameraRig)\n    {\n        OnUpdatedAnchors();\n    }\n}\n\nvoid OnUpdatedAnchors()\n{\n    Vector3 destPos = m_parentTransform.TransformPoint(m_anchorOffsetPosition);\n    Quaternion destRot = m_parentTransform.rotation * m_anchorOffsetRotation;\n\n    if (m_moveHandPosition)\n    {\n        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MovePosition(destPos);\n        GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MoveRotation(destRot);\n    }\n\n    if (!m_parentHeldObject)\n    {\n        MoveGrabbedObject(destPos, destRot);\n    }\n\n    m_lastPos = transform.position;\n    m_lastRot = transform.rotation;\n\n    float prevFlex = m_prevFlex;\n\n    m_prevFlex = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis1D.PrimaryHandTrigger, m_controller);\n\n    CheckForGrabOrRelease(prevFlex);\n}\n```\nThe main changes are:\n\n- The Update() method has been replaced with a FixedUpdate() method, which runs on every fixed frame-rate frame.\n- The GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MovePosition(destPos) and GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MoveRotation(destRot) calls have been added to move the Rigidbody to the desired position and rotation.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug occurs because the physics updates in Unity (using FixedUpdate() method) and the non-physics updates (using Update() method) are resolved at different intervals. Therefore, you need to perform the rigidbody movement within the FixedUpdate() method to ensure the movement is correctly simulated for objects with Rigidbody component.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\n    public override void FixedUpdate()\n    {\n        base.FixedUpdate();\n\n        if (m_operatingWithoutOVRCameraRig)\n        {\n            OnUpdatedAnchors();\n        }\n\n        Debug.DrawRay(transform.position, transform.forward, Color.red, 0.1f);\n\n        DistanceGrabbable target;\n        Collider targetColl;\n        FindTarget(out target, out targetColl);\n\n        if (target != m_target)\n        {\n            if (m_target != null)\n            {\n                m_target.Targeted = m_otherHand.m_target == m_target;\n            }\n\n            m_target = target;\n            m_targetCollider = targetColl;\n            if (m_target != null)\n            {\n                m_target.Targeted = true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nNow, the object's transform is updated in the FixedUpdate() method, and it correctly simulates the physical nature of objects falling in real-world scenarios.",
    "code_repairing_3": "```csharp\n    void FixedUpdate()\n    {\n        if (m_operatingWithoutOVRCameraRig)\n        {\n            OnUpdatedAnchors();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void OnUpdatedAnchors()\n    {\n        Vector3 destPos = m_parentTransform.TransformPoint(m_anchorOffsetPosition);\n        Quaternion destRot = m_parentTransform.rotation * m_anchorOffsetRotation;\n\n        if (m_moveHandPosition)\n        {\n            GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MovePosition(destPos);\n            GetComponent<Rigidbody>().MoveRotation(destRot);\n        }\n\n        if (!m_parentHeldObject)\n        {\n            MoveGrabbedObject(destPos, destRot);\n        }\n\n        m_lastPos = transform.position;\n        m_lastRot = transform.rotation;\n\n        float prevFlex = m_prevFlex;\n\n        m_prevFlex = OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Axis1D.PrimaryHandTrigger, m_controller);\n\n        CheckForGrabOrRelease(prevFlex);\n    }\n```\n\nThe problem with your code is that you are trying to move the Rigidbody of the GameObject associated with your script in the Update() method, but physics interactions like that should happen in FixedUpdate(). The FixedUpdate() is called at a fixed interval that is same as the physics timestep, usually 0.02s in 24 FPS, 0.03333s in 30 FPS, etc. This means that FixedUpdate() is better for physics interactions because it has a stable timestep.\n\nThe solution is to change the Update() method to FixedUpdate(), which will ensure that the Rigidbody will be transformed at each of the fixed intervals. This will simulate the real-world movement with the game's physics.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\n        protected virtual void FixedUpdate()\n        {\n            if (m_operatingWithoutOVRCameraRig)\n            {\n                OnUpdatedAnchors();\n            }\n        }\n```\nThe issue is that the Rigidbody position is being updated in the Update() method, which is not typically where physics simulations should occur. It's better to move the physics simulation to FixedUpdate(), which is called at a fixed frequency by Unity, which is ideal for physics simulations. \n\nChanging the Update() method to FixedUpdate() will ensure that the Rigidbody position is updated at a consistent rate, which is important for accurate physics simulations."
