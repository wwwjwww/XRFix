The code has been updated with the correct function naming conventions. The code has been updated with the correct function names and parameters. The code has been updated to use the Rigidbody component to set the object's kinematic property. The code has been updated to get the RigidBody component using GetComponent, and to set the kinematic property using the isKinematic property. The code has been updated to add a new GameObject as a child of the object, and to set its position, rotation, and name.
