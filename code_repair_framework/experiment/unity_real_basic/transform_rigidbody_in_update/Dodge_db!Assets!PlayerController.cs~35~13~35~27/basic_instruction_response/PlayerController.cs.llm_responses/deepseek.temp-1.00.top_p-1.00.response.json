    "code_repairing_0": "The Unity Engine documentation suggests that it's best to apply a force to a Rigidbody using FixedUpdate() instead of Update() to simulate real-world movement. In addition, the line about \"Transform object of Rigidbody in Update() methods\" doesn't seem to be relevant to your issue, given the code provided. However, I can still suggest a FixedUpdate alternative for you:\n\n```csharp\nvoid FixedUpdate() {\n    float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n    float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n    float xSpeed = xInput * speed;\n    float zSpeed = zInput * speed;\n\n    Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xSpeed, 0f, zSpeed);\n\n    playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;  \n}\n```\n\nThis should make the player's velocity match the input direction and speed, rather than trying to \"force\" movement in Update().",
    "code_repairing_1": "To fix the bug and ensure the correct movement of the player, you should use the `FixedUpdate` method instead of `Update`. The reason is that the `FixedUpdate` method is run at a fixed interval and is generally used to capture time-independent information, such as continuous changes in physics simulations. \n\nHere is how you can rewrite your code with the `FixedUpdate` method:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour {\n    private Rigidbody playerRigidbody; // \uc774\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \ub9ac\uc9c0\ub4dc\ubc14\ub514 \ucef4\ud3ec\ub10c\ud2b8\n    public float speed = 8f; // \uc774\ub3d9 \uc18d\ub825\n\n    void Start() {\n        playerRigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n    }\n\n    private void FixedUpdate() {\n        float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n        float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n        Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(xInput, 0, zInput);\n\n        playerRigidbody.AddForce(moveDirection * speed);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this version of your script, the player's movement is computed in the `FixedUpdate` method. The direction of the movement is determined by the `xInput` and `zInput` variables, which are retrieved from the Input class. The force is then applied to the player's Rigidbody to move it. The `speed` variable determines the magnitude of the force applied.\n\nNote that the previous comments about using `AddForce` in `Update` have been removed. Instead, the player's movement should now be computed and applied in the `FixedUpdate` method to ensure consistent behavior across different frame rates.",
    "code_repairing_2": "You should change Update() method to FixedUpdate() instead. This method is called at a fixed interval and is independent of the frame rate. \n\nYour code should be updated as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvoid FixedUpdate() {\n\n    float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n    float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n    float xSpeed = xInput * speed;\n    float zSpeed = zInput * speed;\n\n    Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xSpeed, 0f, zSpeed);\n\n    playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;\n\n    if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space)) {\n        playerRigidbody.AddForce(0f, speed, 0f);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, we use `FixedUpdate()` instead of `Update()`. This change will prevent your bug, as `FixedUpdate()` is called at a fixed interval which is independent of the frame rate.",

    "code_repairing_4": "Replace the `Update()` method with the `FixedUpdate()` method. The `FixedUpdate()` method is called at a fixed interval and is generally used to implement physics.\n\nHere is an example of how you might adjust your code to use `FixedUpdate()`:\n\n```csharp\nvoid FixedUpdate() {\n    float xInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n    float zInput = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n    float xSpeed = xInput * speed;\n    float zSpeed = zInput * speed;\n\n    Vector3 newVelocity = new Vector3(xSpeed, 0f, zSpeed);\n\n    playerRigidbody.velocity = newVelocity;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the player's speed is determined directly by the user's input, multiplied by the `speed` variable. The `FixedUpdate()` method ensures that this velocity change is calculated at a fixed interval, regardless of the frame rate. This is usually a more suitable way to handle player movement, as it takes into account the physics engine's updates and can therefore simulate real-world movement."
