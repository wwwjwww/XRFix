    "code_repairing_1": "Imagining the world is only made of water, everything we know about the physical properties of matter applies, but with some slight modifications.\n\nObjects fall faster in water than they would in air because the water displaces a larger volume, so a 1kg object will fall faster in water than it would in air. This is because the same amount of gravity pulling down on an object in water will cause it to fall through a smaller volume of water than in air. This is called the buoyancy effect. It's the reason why things float in water.\n\nWater also has some unique properties compared to air. For example, it is a better conductor of heat than air, so it takes longer for water to freeze. Water is also more dense than air, so if you had a column of water and a column of air, the water would be taller.\n\nWater can be a very viscous substance, making it difficult for some substances to flow through it. This is why it's difficult to transport substances through large bodies of water like rivers and oceans by just letting the water flow through itself.\n\nWhile the rules of physics still apply in this world where everything is made of water, there are some key",
