The 'OnTriggerEnter' and 'OnTriggerExit' methods are added to ensure that the player can only throw the object while it's inside the trigger area.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Based on the code snippet you gave, it appears there might be a few issues. Let's address them one by one.\n\n1. There is no `Update` function in your script. You have commented out the `Update` function but are using `Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey)` which is dependent on the `Update` function. In Unity, the `Update` function is required for handling input and other updates in real-time. You could either un-comment the `Update` function or use the `FixedUpdate` function as your main update mechanism if you don't need `Update` function.\n\n2. The `ResetThrow` method is not defined in your code. As it is called using `Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);`, you need to define this method. It should reset the `readyToThrow` to `true` after the throw cooldown.\n\n3. You're checking `if (throwCounter == totalThrows)` after decrementing `totalThrows` at the end of the `Throw` method. As per the code it seems like you want to deactivate armor and activate sword at the last throw. But if `totalThrows` is set to 1 and you throw once, you're disabling armor before activating sword, which might be what you want. But you need to adjust this part according to your project requirement.\n\n4. Make sure `throwKey` is set correctly and matches the key you need for throwing.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the `Update` function:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void Update()\n{\n    if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n    {\n        Throw();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo define `ResetThrow` method:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void ResetThrow()\n{\n    readyToThrow = true;\n}\n```\n\nRemember that the corrected code is subject to your project specifics so further adjustments may be required based on your game mechanics.",
    "code_repairing_4": "void Update()\n{\n    if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n    {\n        Throw();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    readyToThrow = false;\n\n    if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n\n        GameObject thrownObject = Instantiate(objectToThrow, attackPoint.position, attackPoint.rotation);\n        Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n        rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n        throwCounter++;\n    }\n    else if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        armorObject.SetActive(false); // Make the armor disappear\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n        swordObject.SetActive(true); // Make the sword appear\n    }\n\n    totalThrows--;\n\n\n    Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n}\n\nThis code fixes the problem by ensuring the Update function is declared and correctly invoking the Throw function. Without this, when the inCollider is true and the throwKey is pressed, the Update function will not recognize the Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey), causing the function to not work at all. \n\nAlso, the Throw function was missing the declaration of the ResetThrow function, which should be defined elsewhere in your code. This issue has been fixed by adding Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown); to the end of the Throw function, which will call the ResetThrow function after throwCooldown seconds."
