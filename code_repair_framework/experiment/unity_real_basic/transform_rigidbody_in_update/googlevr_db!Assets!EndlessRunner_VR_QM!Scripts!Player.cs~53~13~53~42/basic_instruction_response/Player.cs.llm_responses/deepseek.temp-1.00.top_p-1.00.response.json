    "code_repairing_1": "It looks like you are trying to move an object in Unity using a combination of AddForce and other transform methods causing it to unexpectedly move. You're right in real-world games physics should be handled using FixedUpdate. Here's how you would implement it:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Player : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject cameraRig;\n    public GameObject bike;\n\n    public float speed = 0f;\n    public float maxSpeed = 50f;\n\n    public float acceleration = 0.05f;  // Triggered every second \n    public float deceleration = 0.5f;   // Triggered upon jump\n    public float boost = 0.25f;         // Triggered upon enemyHit  \n\n    public bool reachedFinishLine = false;\n\n    public int score = 0;    //Score for each enemy hit\n\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        cameraRig = GameObject.Find(\"CameraRig\");   //Import CameraRig (Parent of the VR Camera)\n        bike = GameObject.Find(\"Bike\");  //Import the bike \n    }\n\n    void FixedUpdate()\n    {\n        speed += acceleration * Time.fixedDeltaTime;\n        if (speed > maxSpeed) \n        {\n            speed = maxSpeed;   // Setting a max speed \n        }\n\n        Vector3 direction = new Vector3( transform.forward.x, 0,  transform.forward.z); \n\n        bike.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().AddForce(direction.normalized * speed *  Time.fixedDeltaTime, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n\n        if (bike.transform.position.x < -4.5f) \n        {  //Left side \n            bike.transform.position = new Vector3(-4.5f, bike.transform.position.y, bike.transform.position.z); \n        } \n        else if (bike.transform.position.x > 4.5f) \n        {   // Right side\n            bike.transform.position = new Vector3(4.5f, bike.transform.position.y, bike.transform.position.z);\n        }\n\n        // The rest of your code should be handled in FixedUpdate as well...\n    }\n}\n```\nIn `FixedUpdate()`, we use `Rigidbody.AddForce()` to move the bike around. `FixedDeltaTime` is used so that the simulation is smooth and doesn't depend on the frame rate. This way, your bike won't seem to skip frames or have uneven speeds as `Update()` is called faster than `FixedUpdate()`.\n\nOne last thing, you should make sure that your bike object has a Rigidbody component. If it doesn't, you can add one using Unity's built-in editor UI or in your code with `bike.AddComponent<Rigidbody>()`.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code needs to be modified to use `FixedUpdate()` instead of `Update()` for physics related computations.

You should replace `GetComponent<Rigidbody>` with the Rigidbody component you have attached to your Player object.",
