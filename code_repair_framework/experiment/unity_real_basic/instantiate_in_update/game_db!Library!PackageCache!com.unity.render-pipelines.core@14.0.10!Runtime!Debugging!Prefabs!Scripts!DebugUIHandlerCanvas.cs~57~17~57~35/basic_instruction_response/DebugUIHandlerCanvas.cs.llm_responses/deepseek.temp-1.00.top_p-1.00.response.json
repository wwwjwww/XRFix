    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like your code has a bug in Update() method, where instantiating happens in every frame. This can lead to performance issues and memory leaks. Instead of instantiating during Update(), consider using a flag or an event system.\n\nIf you are creating instances of prefabs, do it outside of Update() method or at the start of the game. If the game object to be instantiated depends on user input, it should be done when the input is detected.\n\nIf you want to update something every frame, instead of using Update(), consider using FixedUpdate() or LateUpdate(). Keep in mind that FixedUpdate() is called on a fixed frequency, independent of frame rate.\n\nAs for FIXED CODE, since the question doesn't provide the actual buggy code, I can't provide the fixed code. But I can suggest a general pattern for how to refactor the code.\n\nThe Update() method in your code should look like this:\n\n```csharp\nprivate bool shouldResetHierarchy = false;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (shouldResetHierarchy)\n    {\n        ResetAllHierarchy();\n        shouldResetHierarchy = false;\n    }\n    \n    HandleInput();\n    UpdatePanels();\n}\n\ninternal void RequestHierarchyReset()\n{\n    shouldResetHierarchy = true;\n}\n\nprivate void UpdatePanels()\n{\n    if (m_UIPanels != null && m_SelectedPanel < m_UIPanels.Count && m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel] != null)\n        m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel].UpdateScroll();\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, RequestHierarchyReset() method can now be used to schedule a hierarchy reset. This won't happen until Update() is called, which can be throttled if necessary (e.g., by limiting the number of times Update() is called per second). This gives you more control over when resources are being spent.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your issue is that `Instantiate()` method is being called inside the `Update()` method. This is not efficient because the `Update()` method is called every frame. Instead, you should move the instantiating code to a separate method that can be called at appropriate times. Here's an example:\n\n```C#\nvoid OnEnable()\n{\n    if (prefabs == null)\n        prefabs = new List<DebugUIPrefabBundle>();\n\n    if (m_PrefabsMap == null)\n        m_PrefabsMap = new Dictionary<Type, Transform>();\n\n    if (m_UIPanels == null)\n        m_UIPanels = new List<DebugUIHandlerPanel>();\n\n    DebugManager.instance.RegisterRootCanvas(this);\n\n    Rebuild(); // Call Rebuild method immediately after initialization\n}\n\nvoid Rebuild()\n{\n    // Existing code...\n    // ... except for the call to Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false) here\n\n    // Now, add code to instantiate at the appropriate place\n    InstantiatePrefabs();\n}\n\nvoid InstantiatePrefabs()\n{\n    // Existing code..\n    // ... except for the call to `Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false)` inside the foreach loop\n\n    foreach (var panel in panels)\n    {\n        // Existing code for each panel...\n        // ... except for the call to Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false) here\n\n        // Now, add code to instantiate at the appropriate place\n        InstantiatePrefab(panel);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid InstantiatePrefab(DebugManager.Panel panel)\n{\n    var go = Instantiate(panelPrefab, transform, false).gameObject;\n    // other code...\n    m_UIPanels.Add(uiPanel);\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    // The Update function can now be implemented as follows:\n    int state = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n    if (m_DebugTreeState != state)\n    {\n        ResetAllHierarchy();\n    }\n\n    HandleInput();\n\n    // ... rest of the code can remain unchanged ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the above refactored code, we have moved the instantiating calls into `Rebuild()`, `InstantiatePrefabs()` and `InstantiatePrefab()`. `Update()` method remains unchanged except for the instantiating calls. Instead, `Instantiate()` calls are performed where they are required.\n\nMake sure to adjust the refactored code to fit with your original code as the original context was not provided.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug in the code you provided is that the instantiation of an object is done inside the `Update()` method. This can result in the instantiation happening every single frame, which can result in unnecessary usage of system resources and can also lead to jittery animations. In general, the `Update()` method is not the place to perform heavy operations such as object instantiation.\n\nTo fix this issue, you could move the instantiation of objects to the `Start()` method, which is called only once, when the game starts. Here's an example of how you could modify your `Update()` method to call a new `Start()` method:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Start()\n{\n    Rebuild();\n}\n\n// Other methods...\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    int state = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n    if (m_DebugTreeState != state)\n    {\n        ResetAllHierarchy();\n    }\n\n    HandleInput();\n\n    if (m_UIPanels != null && m_SelectedPanel < m_UIPanels.Count && m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel] != null)\n        m_UIPanels[m_SelectedPanel].UpdateScroll();\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the `Rebuild()` method is called in the `Start()` method, so the instantiation will happen only once after the game starts. The `Update()` method can be used for other parts of the game that need to be updated every frame.\n\nPlease note that in Unity, you should generally avoid using `Instantiate()` in the `Update()` method, as it can cause performance issues. If you need to create objects at runtime, consider using `Instantiate()` in the `Start()` or `Awake()` methods, or other methods specifically designed for object creation in Unity.",

The Instantiate function is called on each frame which leads to unnecessary performance overhead. I have updated the code to instantiate the prefab in the Rebuild method instead.\n\nI have also removed some unnecessary code for brevity.",
    "code_repairing_4": "I don't see your fixed code, but I can provide you with a potential solution to place the instantiation of prefabs in a more efficient manner. You could consider using `Start()` instead of `OnEnable()` for instantiation. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Start()\n{\n    if (prefabs == null)\n        prefabs = new List<DebugUIPrefabBundle>();\n\n    if (m_PrefabsMap == null)\n        m_PrefabsMap = new Dictionary<Type, Transform>();\n\n    if (m_UIPanels == null)\n        m_UIPanels = new List<DebugUIHandlerPanel>();\n\n    DebugManager.instance.RegisterRootCanvas(this);\n    Rebuild();\n}\n\nvoid Rebuild()\n{\n    m_PrefabsMap.Clear();\n    foreach (var bundle in prefabs)\n    {\n        var type = Type.GetType(bundle.type);\n\n        if (type != null && bundle.prefab != null)\n            m_PrefabsMap.Add(type, bundle.prefab);\n    }\n\n    m_UIPanels.Clear();\n\n    m_DebugTreeState = DebugManager.instance.GetState();\n    var panels = DebugManager.instance.panels;\n\n    // The rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the prefabs are instantiated when the object is initialized, and not each frame, which can improve overall efficiency. Please note that it's best to use the correct lifecycle method depending on your specific needs. Always consider whether prefab instantiation should be tied to `Update()` or `FixedUpdate()` or when the object is enabled."
