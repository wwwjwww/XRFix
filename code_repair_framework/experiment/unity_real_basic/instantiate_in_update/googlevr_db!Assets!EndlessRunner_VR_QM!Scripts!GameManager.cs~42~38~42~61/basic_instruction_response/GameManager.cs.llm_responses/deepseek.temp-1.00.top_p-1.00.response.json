    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like the original code was attempting to create and position enemies at specified intervals. The problem here was the method for spawning enemies was being called in the Update function of the GameManager, which is called once per frame, which can lead to performance issues and wasting resources. \n\nTo resolve this, you would need to spawn the enemies at specific intervals, using the InvokeRepeating method in Unity. This method can be used to call a function after a delay, and then repeatedly at a specific interval. \n\nHere is an example of how you might modify your Update function to spawn enemies at specific intervals:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    if (enemyPointer < player.cameraRig.transform.position.z) {\n        enemyPointer += spawnDistanceFromEnemy;\n    }\n\n    gameTimer += Time.deltaTime;   // Increment the game timer \n\n    if (isGamerOver == false) {\n        uiText.text = \"Time: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(gameTimer) + \"   Score: \" + player.score  +  \"   Speed: \" + Mathf.Floor(player.speed) ;\n\n        if (player.reachedFinishLine == true) { // Change Boolean when player hits finish line and save the final time and score\n            isGamerOver = true;\n            finalTime = gameTimer;\n            finalScore = player.score;\n        }\n    } else {  // What to do when the player hits the finish line\n        uiText.text = \"Game Over!\\nTime: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(finalTime) + \"   Score: \" + finalScore + \"\\nRestarting in: \" + Mathf.Floor(gameOverTimer);\n        player.speed = 0.3f;  player.maxSpeed = 0.75f;\n\n        gameOverTimer -= Time.deltaTime;    // Gamer restart logic\n        if (gameOverTimer <= 0) {\n            SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name); \n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic void SpawnEnemy() {\n    // Create an enemy as a child of the Enemies object in the hierarchy\n    GameObject enemyObject = Instantiate(enemyPrefab, new Vector3(Random.Range(-4f, 4f), Random.Range(2.5f, 6.5f), player.cameraRig.transform.position.z + spawnDistanceFromPlayer), Quaternion.identity);\n    enemyObject.transform.parent = GameObject.Find(\"Enemies\").transform;\n}\n\nvoid Start() {\n    finishLine = GameObject.Find(\"FinishLine\");   // Import the Finish Line game object \n    finishLine.transform.position = new Vector3(0,0,finishLinePosition);  // Location to place the finish line object\n    InvokeRepeating(\"SpawnEnemy\", 0f, 1f);  // Spawn an enemy every 1 second\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored version, the SpawnEnemy method is defined and called as a repeating action every second by the InvokeRepeating method. The enemies are now being spawned in a more efficient way.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Based on your description, it seems that you want to implement a feature that spawns enemies at a certain distance from the player when the player is far enough from them. Also, you want to display the game time, score, and speed on the UI. When the player hits the finish line, the game ends and the player's final score and time are recorded. After the game ends, the player will be able to restart the game by pressing a button. However, in the `Update()` function, you're using the `Instantiate()` function, which is supposed to be used inside the `Update()` function, but in this case, it makes sense to use it in a separate function to be more efficient, such as `SpawnEnemy()`. \n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```C#\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.SceneManagement;\n\npublic class GameManager : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    public GameObject enemyPrefab;\n    public Player player;\n\n    private float enemyPointer;     // Calculator for distance of player to enemy\n    public float spawnDistanceFromPlayer = 20f;\n    public float spawnDistanceFromEnemy = 5f;\n\n    public TextMesh uiText;\n\n    public float gameTimer;\n    private float finalTime;\n    private int finalScore;\n    private bool isGameOver = false;\n    private float gameOverTimer = 4.5f;\n\n    public GameObject finishLine;\n    public float finishLinePosition = 200f;\n\n    public float SpawnRate = 2.0f;\n    private float nextEnemy = 0.0f;\n\n    void Start() {\n        finishLine = GameObject.Find(\"FinishLine\");   // Import the Finish Line game object \n        finishLine.transform.position = new Vector3(0,0,finishLinePosition);  // Location to place the finish line object\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        if (Time.time > nextEnemy) \n        {\n            nextEnemy = Time.time + SpawnRate;\n            SpawnEnemy();\n        }\n\n        if (player.reachedFinishLine == true && isGameOver == false) \n        { \n            isGameOver = true;\n            finalTime = gameTimer;\n            finalScore = player.score;\n        }\n\n        if (isGameOver == true) \n        { \n            uiText.text = \"Game Over!\\nTime: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(finalTime) + \"   Score: \" + finalScore + \"\\nRestarting in: \" + Mathf.Floor(gameOverTimer);\n            if (gameOverTimer > 0) {\n                gameOverTimer -= Time.deltaTime;    // Game restart logic\n                player.speed = 0.3f;  player.maxSpeed = 0.75f;\n            } else {\n                SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name); \n            }\n        } \n        else \n        { \n            uiText.text = \"Time: \" + Mathf.FloorToInt(gameTimer) + \"   Score: \" + player.score  +  \"   Speed: \" + Mathf.Floor(player.speed) ;\n            gameTimer += Time.deltaTime;   // Increment the game timer \n        }\n    }\n\n    void SpawnEnemy() {\n        GameObject enemyObject = Instantiate(enemyPrefab);\n        enemyObject.transform.position = new Vector3(Random.Range(-4f, 4f), Random.Range(2.5f, 6.5f), player.cameraRig.transform.position.z + spawnDistanceFromPlayer);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the updated code: \n\n- A new variable `nextEnemy` is added to keep track of the next time when an enemy should be spawned. \n- An infinite loop has been replaced by `if (Time.time > nextEnemy)` to ensure that enemies are spawned at a specific rate. This is controlled by the `SpawnRate` variable.\n- The `SpawnEnemy()` method where the instantiation happens is extracted to a new function.\n- Game over conditions and UI text updates have been corrected. When the game is over, a countdown timer will start and the game will restart after a certain time when the counter reaches 0.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code appears to be missing some parts and is not fully formatted. However, it seems like you are setting up a game where enemies spawn when the player comes close to them, and the goal is to reach a finish line. If that is the case, you might want to spawn enemies at a certain distance from the player and then regularly spawn more enemies at that same distance. Here's a simplified version of your code that should do that:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.SceneManagement;\n\npublic class GameManager : MonoBehaviour {\n\n    public GameObject enemyPrefab;\n    public Player player;\n\n    public float spawnDistanceFromPlayer = 20f;\n    public float spawnTime = 5f;\n    public float gameTimer;\n    public float finishLinePosition = 200f;\n    public GameObject finishLine;\n\n    void Start() {\n        finishLine = GameObject.Find(\"FinishLine\");   \n        finishLine.transform.position = new Vector3(0,0,finishLinePosition);  \n        InvokeRepeating(\"SpawnEnemy\", 0f, spawnTime);\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        gameTimer += Time.deltaTime;   \n    }\n\n    void SpawnEnemy() {\n        GameObject enemyObject = Instantiate(enemyPrefab);\n        enemyObject.transform.position = new Vector3(Random.Range(-4f, 4f), Random.Range(2.5f, 6.5f), player.cameraRig.transform.position.z + spawnDistanceFromPlayer);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code assumes that your `Player` class has a property `cameraRig.transform.position.z` and your `Player` object is set in the GameManager script. \n\nThe `InvokeRepeating` function is used to repeatedly call the `SpawnEnemy` function at fixed intervals (here, every `spawnTime` seconds). The `SpawnEnemy` function creates a new enemy object at a random position near the player.\n\nRemember to attach the Player object and the FinishLine object to the GameManager object in Unity before running the game so they can be accessed in the GameManager script. Also, make sure you have set up the score system and game over condition in your Unity Project. They're not included in this script as the original code is incomplete.",

Putting the game over logic inside an `else` block after finishing the game. This will only be executed when the game is over.\n\n2.
