    "code_repairing_2": "There are several issues with this code:\n\n1. The `Instantiate` method should not be called in the `Update` method as it is not efficient. Instead, move the call to `Instantiate` to the `Start` method.\n2. The `gameTimer` variable is incremented every frame, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It seems like it was intended to keep track of the game's progress, but it is not necessary in this case.\n3. The `finalTime` and `finalScore` variables are assigned to after the `Start` method, but they are used in the `Update` method. This poses a risk of the variables being used before they are assigned.\n4. The `isGamerOver` and `gameOverTimer` variables are assigned to after the `Start` method, but they are used in the `Update` method. This poses a risk of the variables being used before they are assigned.\n5. The `GameObject enemyObject = Instantiate(enemyPrefab);` line is missing a semicolon after it.
