    "code_repairing_1": "Certainly, the major issue here is that we are using `Instantiate()` which calls `Object.Instantiate(Object original, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)` in Unity. This method is called in every frame, which can be resource-greedy and inefficient.\n\nThe `GameObjectPool` class I suggested was specifically made for optimizing this process by creating a pool of objects that can be re-used and returned to the pool after they are no longer needed.\n\nThe issue could not be seen earlier because it's not properly included in the snippet. However, the issue is easily fixable by replacing `Instantiate(enemyPrefab)` with `GetPooledObject()` from your `GameObjectPool` class:\n\n```C#\nif (enemyPointer < player.cameraRig.transform.position.z) \n{\n    enemyPointer += spawnDistanceFromEnemy;\n\n    // use object from pool instead of Instantiate\n    GameObject enemyObject = GetPooledObject();\n    enemyObject.transform.position = new Vector3(Random.Range(-4f, 4f), Random.Range(2.5f, 6.5f), player.cameraRig.transform.position.z + spawnDistanceFromPlayer);\n    // enable the object before use\n    enemyObject.SetActive(true); \n}\n```\n\nDo note that you need to properly set it active if the pooled objects are deactivated at spawn. The above code just enables the object, you may need to configure it further depending on how your game manages its objects.\n\nRemember that you need to implement an \"Expandable Pool\" as it was earlier suggested so that a list of inactive objects which the game can spawn from is created at `Start()`. \n\nThe `ReturnToPool(GameObject obj)` method from the `GameObjectPool` class should be called when the enemy object is no longer needed, it should be implemented like this in the enemy script:\n\n```C#\nprivate void ReturnToPool()\n{\n    GameObjectPool.GetInstance().ReturnToPool(gameObject);\n}\n```\n\nYou can call `ReturnToPool()` method in the `OnDestroy()` method if you just destroy the enemy object manually due to some reason.",

When the player gets close enough to an enemy, the game requests an inactive enemy GameObject from the pool, assigns it a new position and activates it. This way, it avoids instantiating new enemies in every frame. Since the enemies are reused, it also reduces memory usage and overall efficiency of the game.",

SpawnEnemy() method is responsible for instantiating enemy prefabs. This is better because it is moved out of Update() and is only called when the conditions are met, ensuring better efficiency."
