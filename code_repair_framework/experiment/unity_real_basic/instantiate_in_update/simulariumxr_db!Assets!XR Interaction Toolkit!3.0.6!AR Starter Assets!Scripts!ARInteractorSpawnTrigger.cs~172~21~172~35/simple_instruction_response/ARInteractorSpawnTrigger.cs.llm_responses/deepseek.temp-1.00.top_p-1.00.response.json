    "code_repairing_0": "The code you provided doesn't seem to have any bug. However, if you are getting any errors or unexpected results, it's hard to provide a proper fix without knowing the context in which this code is being used. Here are some general tips to debug your code:\n\n1. Ensure all necessary components (like ARFoundation, Interaction Toolkit, and Input System) are installed and configured correctly.\n\n2. Check that ARInteractorSpawnTrigger is properly attached to an object that has an ARInteractor component, and that ObjectSpawner has been set properly in the ARInteractorSpawnTrigger.\n\n3. Make sure the ARPlane is being tracked by ARFoundation. If you're using ARCore or ARKit, you should see the ARPlanes in the Scene View window. If they're not visible, that might be the problem.\n\n4. Check for infinite loops or any other potential infinite loops in your code.\n\n5. If you are using a SpawnTriggerType.InputAction, make sure the input action 'Spawn Object' is properly configured in your Input System settings.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please provide more context or specific conditions that are causing the issue so I can give a more precise answer.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue is related to the absence of the Update method in the script. The Update method is mandatory for a MonoBehaviour script to work properly. This is why it is commented out in the provided code. To fix this issue, you should uncomment the Update method.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```C#\n#if AR_FOUNDATION_PRESENT\nusing UnityEngine.EventSystems;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Inputs.Readers;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Interactors;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.StarterAssets;\n\nnamespace UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.ARStarterAssets\n{\n    public class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        // Rest of the code...\n\n        // Uncomment the Update method by removing the '//' before 'void Update()'\n        void Update()\n        {\n            // Rest of the code...\n        }\n\n        // Rest of the code...\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the updated code, the Update method is back and ready to use.

If the UnityEngine.Random.Range function is not supported due to some reason, replace `UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, m_ObjectPrefabs.Count)` with `m_SpawnOptionIndex >= 0 && m_SpawnOptionIndex < m_ObjectPrefabs.Count ? m_SpawnOptionIndex : UnityEngine.Random.Range(0, m_ObjectPrefabs.Count)`.\n3. I replaced `Quaternion.LookRotation` with `Quaternion.LookRotation(projectedForward, spawnNormal)` as it seems `Quaternion.LookRotation` is expecting a direction vector, but a normal vector might be also be fine.\n4. I removed the redundant `transform.childCount > 0` check as this seems to have been moved to the caller where it makes sense to prevent unnecessary object spawning.\n5. Added `using UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Utilities;` to support `BurstMathUtility`.",

The issue with the original code was related to the missing function `IsPointInView`. I've added this function which checks if a point is inside the view frustum of the camera by transforming it to viewport space and checking the x, y coordinates against the viewport dimensions with an offset of `m_ViewportPeriphery`. The function `TrySpawnObject` has been updated to call this function and use the results to control whether or not to spawn the object.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Based on the context, it appears the error could be related to a null reference when trying to access a non-existing object or component. However, the issue cannot be fully diagnosed without the full context about what's going wrong.\n\nThe Update function is commented as if it's the buggy part. If the bug happened in the commented part, you may run into issues because Update is not called in this case. This might be the root of your problem. You may need to uncomment the code or find an alternative way to handle this logic.\n\nThe TrySpawnObject function was also commented to be removed. If this function's issue could be the root of your problem, this would need to be uncommented.\n\nAlso, make sure that the referenced scripts are correctly imported and that they are compatible with the version of the XR Interaction Toolkit you're using. \n\nWithout more concrete information about the error message or the application behavior, a more specific diagnosis or solution cannot be provided. It would be beneficial to provide more information about the issue you're experiencing."
