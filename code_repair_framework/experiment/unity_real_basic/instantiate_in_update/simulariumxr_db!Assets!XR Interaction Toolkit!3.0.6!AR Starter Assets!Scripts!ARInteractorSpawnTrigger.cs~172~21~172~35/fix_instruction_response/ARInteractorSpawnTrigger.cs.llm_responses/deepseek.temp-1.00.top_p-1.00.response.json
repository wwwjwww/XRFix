    "code_repairing_0": "The issue in your provided code is that you are instantiating objects in the `Update()` method of `ARInteractorSpawnTrigger` class. This is not a recommended practice because the `Update()` method is called every frame, which can be quite resource-intensive if you are spawning objects every frame.\n\nIn general, objects that need to be spawned or updated in real-time (like bullets, particles, or interactable object in AR environments) should be managed in the `FixedUpdate()` method instead.\n\nHere is the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\n// Add a bool flag to check if Update() method has been called before.\nbool hasUpdated = false;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (!hasUpdated) \n    {\n        hasUpdated = true;\n        SpawnObject();\n    }\n}\n\nvoid SpawnObject()\n{\n    if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n    {\n        m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n        var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n        if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n        {\n            if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                return;\n\n            if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                return;\n\n            m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Rest of your code...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the object spawning will happen after the first frame (since `hasUpdated` is set to true), and it won't happen again in each frame. This will potentially improve the performance of your application.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that you want the object spawning to occur only once per frame. If you want to spawn something every time the Update method is called, you should move the object spawning code to the Update method and remove the `m_AttemptSpawn` flag.",
    "code_repairing_1": "You can fix this issue by using a separate method to handle spawning objects, rather than having it in a `Update()` method. \n\nIn your `ARInteractorSpawnTrigger` class, you can create a new method called `AttemptSpawn()`. In this method, you can check the conditions for spawning an object. Then, you can call this method in the `Update()` method instead of using `Instantiate()`. Here is an example of how you can do it:\n\n```C#\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.ARSubsystems;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Inputs.Readers;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Interactors;\nusing UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.StarterAssets;\n\nnamespace UnityEngine.XR.Interaction.Toolkit.Samples.ARStarterAssets\n{\n    public class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        // Your original code...\n\n        // New method to handle object spawning\n        public void AttemptSpawn()\n        {\n            if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n            {\n                m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n                \n                var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n                if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n                {\n                    if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                        return;\n\n                    if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                        return;\n\n                    m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        void Update()\n        {\n            var selectState = m_ARInteractor.logicalSelectState;\n\n            if (m_BlockSpawnWhenInteractorHasSelection)\n            {\n                if (selectState.wasPerformedThisFrame)\n                    m_EverHadSelection = m_ARInteractor.hasSelection;\n                else if (selectState.active)\n                    m_EverHadSelection |= m_ARInteractor.hasSelection;\n            }\n\n            m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n            switch (m_SpawnTriggerType)\n            {\n                case SpawnTriggerType.SelectAttempt:\n                    if (selectState.wasCompletedThisFrame)\n                        m_AttemptSpawn = !m_ARInteractor.hasSelection && !m_EverHadSelection;\n                    break;\n\n                case SpawnTriggerType.InputAction:\n                    if (m_SpawnObjectInput.ReadWasPerformedThisFrame())\n                        m_AttemptSpawn = !m_ARInteractor.hasSelection && !m_EverHadSelection;\n                    break;\n            }\n\n            // Call the new method here\n            AttemptSpawn();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, the object spawning logic is separated into a new method `AttemptSpawn()`, which is called by the `Update()` method. This way, you keep the `Update()` method clean by eliminating the use of `Instantiate()`, making your code more readable and easier to debug.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug in your code is that you are using Instantiate() in Update() method, which is inefficient because Update() method is called at a fixed rate, and each frame Instantiate() is called can lead to performance issues. Instantiation takes time and should not be done in the Update method. \n\nInstead, you should instantiate the objects in the Start() method or in the event that triggers object spawning, like the FixedUpdate() method or whenever a specific action occurs. For example, you could trigger the spawning when the player presses a button.\n\nHere's an example fix for your code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARInteractorSpawnTrigger : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ...\n\n    // Store the GameObject here\n    private GameObject spawnedObject;\n\n    // Call the spawning method from the place you know it should be called\n    // This could be in the FixedUpdate, or in a method that you call from a button press, etc.\n    void SpawnObject()\n    {\n        if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n        {\n            m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n\n            var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n\n            if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n            {\n                if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                    return;\n\n                if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                    return;\n\n                // Instantiate the object here\n                spawnedObject = m_ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject(arRaycastHit.pose.position, arPlane.normal);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this way, you are not calling Instantiate() every frame and your FPS rate would not be affected. The object won't be destroyed after being spawned; it will be stored in a variable and you can access it if needed. Please adapt this example to fit your exact needs.",

This class will be responsible for creating a pool of objects to be instantiated. In this class, we create a list of GameObjects called pooledObjects that will hold our instantiated objects.\n\nIn the Start() method, we create a number of objects equal to the amount of objects in m_ObjectPrefabs and set them to be inactive as a default state. \n\nIn the GetPooledObject() method, we search through the list of pooledObjects. If an inactive GameObject is found, we set it to be active and return it. This will allow us to Reuse these objects instead of having to constantly instantiate new ones.\n\nPlease note that the amount of objects you want to pool should be assigned to the variable amountToPool.\n\nThis way, we can instantiate objects when required, instead of constantly instantiating new ones, which is more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The bug is in the Update() method in the ARInteractorSpawnTrigger.cs script. The Instantiate() function is being called in this method, which is not a good practice as it can cause performance issues. Instead, we should build an object pool before the Update() method has been called. The pool will hold the prefabs that need to be instantiated. \n\nThe object pool concept reduces the number of instantiations by reducing the need to create new objects each frame. It is a type of design pattern used to improve program efficiency.\n\nHere is the code to create an object pool:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ObjectPooler : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public static ObjectPooler Instance;\n    public List<GameObject> pooledObjects;\n    public GameObject objectToPool;\n    public int pooledAmount;\n\n    void Awake()\n    {\n        Instance = this;\n    }\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        pooledObjects = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledAmount; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectToPool);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pooledObjects.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public GameObject GetPooledObject()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < pooledObjects.Count; i++)\n        {\n            if (!pooledObjects[i].activeInHierarchy)\n                return pooledObjects[i];\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn your ARInteractorSpawnTrigger.cs script, you can replace the Instantiate() function with ObjectPooler.Instance.GetPooledObject():\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (m_AttemptSpawn)\n    {\n        m_AttemptSpawn = false;\n        \n        var isPointerOverUI = EventSystem.current != null && EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject(-1);\n        if (!isPointerOverUI && m_ARInteractor.TryGetCurrentARRaycastHit(out var arRaycastHit))\n        {\n            if (!(arRaycastHit.trackable is ARPlane arPlane))\n                return;\n\n            if (m_RequireHorizontalUpSurface && arPlane.alignment != PlaneAlignment.HorizontalUp)\n                return;\n\n            GameObject obj = ObjectPooler.Instance.GetPooledObject(); // Get object from pool\n            if (obj != null)\n            {\n                obj.transform.position = arRaycastHit.pose.position;\n                obj.transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(arPlane.normal);\n                obj.SetActive(true);\n            }\n        }\n\n        return;\n    }\n    // rest of the code...\n}\n```\n\nThis way, instead of creating a new object each frame, the script will look for an inactive object in the pool and activate it, which will improve performance."
