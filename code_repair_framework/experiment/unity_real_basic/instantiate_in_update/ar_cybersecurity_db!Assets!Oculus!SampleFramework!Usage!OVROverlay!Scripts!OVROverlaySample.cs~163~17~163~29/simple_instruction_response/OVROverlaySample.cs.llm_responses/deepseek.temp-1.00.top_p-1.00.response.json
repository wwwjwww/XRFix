    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like your code is missing its implementation. However, based on your context, it seems you're trying to enable cubemap overlay during level loading simulation. Here's a basic implementation of `SimulateLevelLoad` function:\n\n```csharp\nvoid SimulateLevelLoad()\n{\n    // Get player position\n    Vector3 playerPos = mainCamera.transform.position;\n    playerPos.y = 0.5f;\n\n    // Loop through levels\n    for (int j = 0; j < numLevels; j++)\n    {\n        string levelName = \"Level \" + j.ToString();\n        Debug.Log(\"Loading \" + levelName);\n\n        // Spawn cubes\n        for (int i = 0; i < numObjectsPerLevel; i++)\n        {\n            // Calculate position and rotation for each cube\n            float angle = i * Mathf.PI * 2 / numObjectsPerLevel;\n            float stagger = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1.5f : 1.0f;\n            Vector3 pos = new Vector3(Mathf.Cos(angle), 0, Mathf.Sin(angle)) * cubeSpawnRadius * stagger;\n            pos.y = j * heightBetweenItems;\n\n            // Instantiate cube\n            var newInst = Instantiate(prefabForLevelLoadSim, pos + playerPos, Quaternion.identity);\n            newInst.name = levelName + \" \" + i.ToString();\n\n            // Add cube to list\n            spawnedCubes.Add(newInst);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this function, we're spawning `numObjectsPerLevel` cubes per `numLevels` layers. The cubes are evenly distributed around a full circle, with a certain 'stagger' applied to space them out a bit. We're also setting a unique name for each cube based on its level and index.\n\nYou might need to adjust this further to suit your specific needs.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Sure, here's a fixed version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid SimulateLevelLoad()\n{\n    int numToPrint = 0;\n    int numLoopsTrigger = 500000000;\n    for (int p = 0; p < numLoopsTrigger; p++)\n    {\n        numToPrint++;\n    }\n\n    Debug.Log(\"Finished \" + numToPrint + \" Loops\");\n    Vector3 playerPos = mainCamera.transform.position;\n    playerPos.y = 0.5f;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < numLevels; j++)\n    {\n        for (var i = 0; i < numObjectsPerLevel; i++)\n        {\n            var angle = i * Mathf.PI * 2 / numObjectsPerLevel;\n            float stagger = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1.5f : 1.0f;\n            var pos = new Vector3(Mathf.Cos(angle), 0, Mathf.Sin(angle)) * cubeSpawnRadius * stagger;\n            pos.y = j * heightBetweenItems;\n            var newInst = Instantiate(prefabForLevelLoadSim, pos + playerPos, Quaternion.identity);\n            var newObjTransform = newInst.transform;\n            newObjTransform.LookAt(playerPos);\n            Vector3 newAngle = newObjTransform.rotation.eulerAngles;\n            newAngle.x = 0.0f;\n            newObjTransform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(newAngle);\n            spawnedCubes.Add(newInst);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code declares the variable numLoopsTrigger and initializes it in the loop, which was previously uninitialized. This should fix the compiler error.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you're having trouble with the OVROverlaySample script. However, without a specific error or issue description, it's challenging to identify the exact issue at hand. Could you provide more details about the problem you're experiencing or the error you're receiving? Further information, such as the context in which the issue occurs or the specific part of the code where the problem is, can also be helpful.",
    "code_repairing_3": "```csharp\nprivate void SimulateLevelLoad()\n{\n    int numToPrint = 0;\n    for (int p = 0; p < numLoopsTrigger; p++)\n    {\n        numToPrint++;\n    }\n\n    Debug.Log(\"Finished \" + numToPrint + \" Loops\");\n    Vector3 playerPos = mainCamera.transform.position;\n    playerPos.y = 0.5f;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < numLevels; j++)\n    {\n        for (var i = 0; i < numObjectsPerLevel; i++)\n        {\n            var angle = i * Mathf.PI * 2 / numObjectsPerLevel;\n            float stagger = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1.5f : 1.0f;\n            var pos = new Vector3(Mathf.Cos(angle), 0, Mathf.Sin(angle)) * cubeSpawnRadius * stagger;\n            pos.y = j * heightBetweenItems;\n            var newInst = Instantiate(prefabForLevelLoadSim, pos + playerPos, Quaternion.identity);\n            var newObjTransform = newInst.transform;\n            newObjTransform.LookAt(playerPos);\n            Vector3 newAngle = newObjTransform.rotation.eulerAngles;\n            newAngle.x = 0.0f;\n            newObjTransform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(newAngle);\n            spawnedCubes.Add(newInst);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code has fixed the loop operation that was causing issues in the previous version.",
    "code_repairing_4": "You didn't provide the solution to the problem you're having with your code, so I can only suggest a general solution. However, your code seems to be missing a few important bits. Unfortunately, there's no enough information to correct the problem. \n\nIf the OVROverlaySample class doesn't have the `SimulateLevelLoad()` function, the `TriggerLoad()` coroutine could be stuck in an infinite loop. If the breakpoint is hit multiple times per trigger, it may suggest a logic error or it could also be that your Oculus Link isn't properly connected or the Oculus integration isn't correctly set up.\n\nWithout further details, it's hard to guarantee a solution that fits your particular code situation. If you could provide more code context, I might be able to help a bit more with your code. \n\nHere is a general approach to `SimulateLevelLoad()` based on your provided code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid SimulateLevelLoad()\n{\n    int numToPrint = 0;\n    for (int p = 0; p < numLoopsTrigger; p++)\n    {\n        numToPrint++;\n    }\n\n    Debug.Log(\"Finished \" + numToPrint + \" Loops\");\n    Vector3 playerPos = mainCamera.transform.position;\n    playerPos.y = 0.5f;\n\n    for (int j = 0; j < numLevels; j++)\n    {\n        for (var i = 0; i < numObjectsPerLevel; i++)\n        {\n            var angle = i * Mathf.PI * 2 / numObjectsPerLevel;\n            float stagger = (i % 2 == 0) ? 1.5f : 1.0f;\n            var pos = new Vector3(Mathf.Cos(angle), 0, Mathf.Sin(angle)) * cubeSpawnRadius * stagger;\n            pos.y = j * heightBetweenItems;\n            var newInst = Instantiate(prefabForLevelLoadSim, pos + playerPos, Quaternion.identity);\n            var newObjTransform = newInst.transform;\n            newObjTransform.LookAt(playerPos);\n            Vector3 newAngle = newObjTransform.rotation.eulerAngles;\n            newAngle.x = 0.0f;\n            newObjTransform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(newAngle);\n            spawnedCubes.Add(newInst);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code creates instances of `prefabForLevelLoadSim` in the game world based on the values specified by the variables `numLoopsTrigger`, `numLevels`, `numObjectsPerLevel`, `cubeSpawnRadius`, and `heightBetweenItems`. Please review this code and adapt it to your circumstances."
