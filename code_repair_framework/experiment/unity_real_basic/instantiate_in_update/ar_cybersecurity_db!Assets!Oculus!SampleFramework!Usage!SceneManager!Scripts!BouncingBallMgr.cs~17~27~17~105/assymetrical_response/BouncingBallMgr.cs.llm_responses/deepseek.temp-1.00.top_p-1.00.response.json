    "code_repairing_0": "It looks like you're implementing a Unity script for managing a bouncing ball game. This script is using Oculus's OVRInput for user input and it seems like you want to create and control a bouncing ball. The script seems incomplete but here is a possible continuation of the script:\n\n```csharp\n    private Vector3 lastBallPosition;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        OVRInput.updateSource(); // You need to update the input source\n        lastBallPosition = ball.transform.position;\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        OVRInput.updateSource();\n\n        if (OVRInput.get(actionBtn)) // check if the action button is pressed\n        {\n            if (!ballGrabbed)\n            {\n                currentBall = Instantiate(ball, rightControllerPivot.transform.position, Quaternion.identity); // Instantiate a new ball\n                currentBall.transform.parent = trackingspace; // set new ball as a child of tracking space\n\n                ballGrabbed = true;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if (ballGrabbed)\n            {\n                ballGrabbed = false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (ballGrabbed)\n        {\n            if (Vector3.Distance(currentBall.transform.position, lastBallPosition) < 0.01f)\n            {\n                Debug.Log(\"Ball is at the same position, bounce it!\");\n                // Code to bounce the ball\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                lastBallPosition = currentBall.transform.position;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis script creates a new ball when the action button is pressed and checks if the ball is moving to determine whether it should be bounced or not. It also keeps track of the last position of the ball to determine if the ball is still.\n\nPlease note that you will need to implement the bounce functionality yourself.",
