    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like the bug is related to instantiating objects in the Update method, which is not efficient as it can cause performance issues, especially in larger projects where frames per second (FPS) are limited. \n\nFurthermore, when there are multiple objects being instantiated in the update method, they'll interfere with each other as they all get a frame of execution at once and would not be coordinated properly in the game loop.\n\nA better approach would be to instantiate objects at the start of the game during the initialization phase (Start method), and not during every frame during the game loop. \n\nAlso, in the original code, \"gobj\" was never defined which was supposed to hold the instantiated game object. So I'll add it to the scope where it might be used, and move the instantiation part to Start method like so.\n\n```csharp\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int poolSize = 10;\n    private List<GameObject> pool;\n    public GameObject gobj; // add this line to the class scope\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pool.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (Input.GetButtonDown(\"Fire1\"))\n        {\n            GameObject gobj = GetPooledObject();\n            gobj.SetActive(true); // maybe set the object to active when it's obtained from pool\n        }\n        else if(Input.GetButtonUp(\"Release\"))\n        {\n            ReturnToPool(gobj);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nPlease note that without full context of the rest of your program, it's hard to say if the above changes will work or if they need additional changes too.",

I've replaced all direct instantiations of GameObjects with object pooling. I've added a class variable 'GameObject.pool' of type 'GameObjectPool' to the ThrowingTutorial class. This should be instantiated somewhere in your codebase. I've also moved the ResetThrow method outside the Update method so that it can be called by Invoke upon throwing, with a delay of throwCooldown."
