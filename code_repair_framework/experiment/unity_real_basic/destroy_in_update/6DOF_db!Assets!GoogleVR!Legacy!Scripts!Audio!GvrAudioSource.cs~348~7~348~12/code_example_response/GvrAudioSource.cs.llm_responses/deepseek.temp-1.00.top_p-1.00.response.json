    "code_repairing_0": "Your problem is with the line \"Destroy(gobj);\" in the Update() function, which will not work because there is no instance of \"gobj\" outside of the scope of the Update() function. In the context you've provided, \"gobj\" is defined within the \"if\" block that fires when Input.GetButtonDown(\"Fire1\") is called. So it doesn't exist after the block finishes executing unless it's declared outside of the function as a class property. \n\nGiven your requirement to manage a pool of GameObjects, you should make the \"gobj\" variable a class property and access it globally. Otherwise, this is a misuse of object pooling and can lead to errors elsewhere in your code.\n\nAdditionally, if you are managing a pool of objects and you need to destroy and respawn them, you might want to use a method like ReturnToPool instead of directly calling Destroy.\n\nIf this doesn't fit your use case, then please provide more context so I can better assist you.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your task is to fix the code under the 'FIXED CODE:' area. In your response, only include your fixed code snippets. Do not output the original contents. Please only change the code from /Assets/GoogleVR/Legacy/Scripts/Audio/GvrAudioSource.cs\n\n1) In the 'Update' method, the `Destroy` function is called in each frame. This can lead to inefficiency as `Destroy` is a costly operation. It should be called when necessary, such as when an object is no longer needed. Here is the corrected code:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update () {\n    if (isPlaying && isPaused) {\n        Stop();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCorrected:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update () {\n    if (!isPlaying && !isPaused) {\n        Stop();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2) The `ShutdownSource` function in the `GvrAudioSource` class is calling `DestroyAudioSource`, which is presumably a function to destroy an audio source. It seems that `id` is a field that stores the ID of an audio source. Before calling it, it should be checked if `id` is greater or equal to 0. Here is the corrected code:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void ShutdownSource () {\n    if (id >= 0) {\n        audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.Id, -1.0f);\n        audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.ZeroOutput, 1.0f);\n        audioSource.spatialize = false;\n        GvrAudio.DestroyAudioSource(id);\n        id = -1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCorrected:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void ShutdownSource () {\n    if (id >= 0) {\n        audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.Id, -1.0f);,;; \n        audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.ZeroOutput, 1.0f);\n        audioSource.spatialize = false;\n        GvrAudio.DestroyAudioSource(id);\n        id = -1;\n    }\n}\n```\nJust a note on the corrected code, removing the `audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat` calls might lead to an error because we don't have an instance of `GvrAudio`. You will need to replace this with the relevant calls if necessary.",

    "code_repairing_4": "The issue with the buggy code is the use of `Destroy()` in the `Update()` method which can cause performance issues because it is called each frame. However, in this specific case, we need to ensure that the object is destroyed when it is not used anymore. \n\nThe solution is to move the `Destroy()` call inside the `ReturnToPool()` method.
