    "code_repairing_0": "Based on the code you've provided, it appears that you've fixed the issue. You mentioned that the `ShutdownSource` method was left out of the previous revision of the `GvrAudioSource` class. So, now the `GvrAudioSource` class has a `ShutdownSource` method. It's called in the `OnDisable` and `OnDestroy` events to ensure proper cleanup of the audio source.\n\nThe `Update` method was also removed, as it seemed to be unused in the context of this class.\n\nThe main changes are the addition of the `ShutdownSource` method and removal of the `Update` method. The `ShutdownSource` method is called in the `OnDisable` and `OnDestroy` events. This ensures that the audio source is cleaned up when the component is disabled or destroyed.\n\nMake sure that the `ShutdownSource` method is correctly implemented to properly clean up the audio source.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Without the specific issue or bug that you're experiencing, I can only provide a general solution for your question. Please provide more information so that I can help you better.\n\nAs per your last comment, you mentioned that your current implementation only handles the occlusion for one specific AudioSource. In order to apply a common occlusion effect to multiple audio sources, you could modify your Update() function to loop through all active instances of GvrAudioSource and apply the occlusion calculations to each one.\n\nHere's a simplified example of what that might look like:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    GvrAudioSource[] audioSources = Object.FindObjectsOfType<GvrAudioSource>();\n    foreach (GvrAudioSource source in audioSources)\n    {\n        if (!source.occlusionEnabled)\n        {\n            source.currentOcclusion = 0.0f;\n        }\n        else if (Time.time >= source.nextOcclusionUpdate)\n        {\n            source.nextOcclusionUpdate = Time.time + GvrAudio.occlusionDetectionInterval;\n            source.currentOcclusion = GvrAudio.ComputeOcclusion(source.transform);\n        }\n\n        if (!source.isPlaying && !source.isPaused)\n        {\n            source.Stop();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            source.audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int)GvrAudio.SpatializerData.Gain, GvrAudio.ConvertAmplitudeFromDb(source.gainDb));\n            source.audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int)GvrAudio.SpatializerData.MinDistance, source.sourceMinDistance);\n            GvrAudio.UpdateAudioSource(source.id, source, source.currentOcclusion);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `Object.FindObjectsOfType<GvrAudioSource>()` is used to find all active instances of the GvrAudioSource class. The loop goes through each of these instances and performs the same tasks as your original script.\n\nPlease replace `GvrAudio` with your custom occlusion and audio source manager. Moreover, you might want to consider other ways to reduce boilerplate code such as separating the code into its own class or function then call them repeatedly.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The provided code snippet after '// FIXED CODE:' is not complete. However, I can suggest you some areas where changes can be made.\n\n1. You might need to replace `SourceCurve.AnimationCurve.Linear` with the `AnimationCurve` you have created.\n\n2. You should replace `GvrAudio.DistanceEpsilon` with `sourceMinDistance + GvrAudio.distanceEpsilon`, same as the max distance.\n\n3. You should call the `GvrAudio.UpdateAudioSource` method after the spatializer settings are set, not inside the `OnValidate` method.\n\n4. It looks like `ShutdownSource` method is not implemented in the fixed code you provided. Without knowing what it should do, I would suggest keeping it or removing it.\n\n5. `OnValidate` method is not defined in the original code. If you want to perform some validation when a property is changed, you must define it.\n\nRemember to replace `GvrAudio.distanceEpsilon`, `GvrAudio.maxDistanceLimit`, `GvrAudio.minDistanceLimit`, `GvrAudio.occlusionDetectionInterval`, and `GvrAudio.SpatializerData` with actual values. Also, `GvrAudio.SpatializerType.Source` should be replaced with actual HRTF enum if exists.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Based on your description, it seems like you are asking for a specific correction to an issue with the provided code lines. However, the code you provided is incomplete, and I'm not sure which part you are referring to. \n\nCould you please provide more details or the code you're interested in so I can assist you better?",
    "code_repairing_4": "Your question is missing, so I'm not sure what you want to fix in the code. However, I can help you with some common issues related to audio in Unity.\n\n1. Set AudioListener3D: Make sure that your game scene has an AudioListener component.\n\n2. Ensure Audio Source Component: The audio source may not be assigned properly and could result in NullReferenceExceptions. Make sure you assign the audioSource variable in the Inspector.\n\n3. Enable GvrAudioServices: This script needs GvrAudioServices enabled.\n\n4. Incorrect rolloffMode: If you're seeing any sound artifacts or unnatural sound behavior, most likely the `rolloffMode` has not been set to `AudioRolloffMode.Linear` or `AudioRolloffMode.Logarithmic`.\n\n5. Assigning Audio Clip: Ensure that you are assigning an Audio Clip in the inspector.\n\nHere is an example of how they might look:\n\n```csharp\npublic class TestAudio : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public AudioSource audioSource;\n    public AudioClip audioClip;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        audioSource.clip = audioClip;\n    }\n\n    public void PlayAudio()\n    {\n        audioSource.Play();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide more specific details about what the bug is or what you are expecting to happen so I can provide a more accurate solution."
