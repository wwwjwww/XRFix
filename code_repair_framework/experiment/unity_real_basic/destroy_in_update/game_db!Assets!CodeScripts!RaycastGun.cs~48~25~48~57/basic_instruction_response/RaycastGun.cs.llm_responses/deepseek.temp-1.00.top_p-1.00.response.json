    "code_repairing_0": "You can use a coroutine in Unity to delay the destruction of the object. By using the `yield` statement, you can pause the execution of the `Update` method until the duration of the laser is over, then destroy the object. Here is the fixed part of your code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (isPlayerOnObject)\n    {\n        fireTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.K) && fireTimer > fireRate)\n        {\n            fireTimer = 0;\n            laserLine.SetPosition(0, laserOrigin.position);\n            Vector3 rayOrigin = playerCamera.ViewportToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0));\n            RaycastHit hit;\n            if (Physics.Raycast(rayOrigin, playerCamera.transform.forward, out hit, gunRange))\n            {\n                if (hit.collider.gameObject == Object)\n                {\n                    audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.swordSound);\n                    laserLine.SetPosition(1, hit.point);\n                    audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n                    // Destroy the object after lasing duration\n                    StartCoroutine(WaitAndDestroy(hit.transform.gameObject));\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    laserLine.SetPosition(1, rayOrigin + (playerCamera.transform.forward * gunRange));\n                }\n\n                StartCoroutine(ShootLaser());\n\n                if (Object == null)\n                {\n                    GameOver();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIEnumerator WaitAndDestroy(GameObject obj)\n{\n    // Wait for laser duration\n    yield return new WaitForSeconds(laserDuration);\n    // Destroy the object\n    Destroy(obj);\n    Object = null; // Destroyed object\n}\n```\n\nThe `WaitAndDestroy` function is defined as a coroutine that waits for `laserDuration` seconds and then destroys the passed in `GameObject`. This `GameObject` is what is being destroyed once the laser hits an object. The `StartCoroutine(WaitAndDestroy(hit.transform.gameObject));` line starts this coroutine.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The issue is that you're using the `Destroy` function in the `Update` method which makes it happen every frame. You shouldn't do that as it's inefficient and can cause problems. Also, you're assigning `Object = null;` but this variable is not being used anywhere else, so it doesn't seem to be necessary. \n\nYou can refactor your code to use the `OnCollisionEnter` method instead. This method is called when a object collides with another object in Unity. \n\nHere's a possible refactor:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)\n{\n    if (collision.gameObject == Object)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.swordSound);\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        Destroy(collision.gameObject);\n        Object = null; // Optional if you don't need to keep track of it\n    }\n}\n\nIEnumerator ShootLaser()\n{\n    yield return new WaitForSeconds(laserDuration);\n    laserLine.enabled = false;\n}\n\nvoid GameOver()\n{\n    SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactor, when the object collides with another one, the `OnCollisionEnter` method is called. If the game object collides with the object you want to destroy (`Object`), the object is destroyed and `Object` is set to `null`. The `Destroy` method is called after the audio has played, so the object won't be visible during the playing of the audio. \n\nFinally, I removed the unnecessary `StartCoroutine(ShootLaser());` calls and left the laser line deactivation to the `ShootLaser` coroutine. The `GameOver` method is called if the `Object` is `null`, which in theory would trigger when you destroy the last object. This method reloads the current scene. Please adjust according to your needs.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code is almost there. However, you have to consider some things:\n\n1. The `Update()` method is called every frame. If you put `Destroy(hit.transform.gameObject);` in here, you will destroy the object every frame the raycast hits it. That's why you should put it in a coroutine.\n\n2. You should create a separate method to handle the laser line and the shooting of the ray. You can call this method from the `Update()` method.\n\n3. You should create a separate method to handle the game over condition. After destroying the object, you can call this method.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class RaycastGun : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    //...\n\n    public void Update()\n    {\n        if (isPlayerOnObject)\n        {\n            if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.K) && fireTimer > fireRate)\n            {\n                fireTimer = 0;\n                ShootRay();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    void ShootRay()\n    {\n        laserLine.SetPosition(0, laserOrigin.position);\n        Vector3 rayOrigin = playerCamera.ViewportToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0));\n        RaycastHit hit;\n        if (Physics.Raycast(rayOrigin, playerCamera.transform.forward, out hit, gunRange))\n        {\n            if (hit.collider.gameObject == Object)\n            {\n                audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.swordSound);\n                laserLine.SetPosition(1, hit.point);\n                StartCoroutine(DestroyObject(hit.transform.gameObject));\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                laserLine.SetPosition(1, rayOrigin + (playerCamera.transform.forward * gunRange));\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            laserLine.SetPosition(1, rayOrigin + (playerCamera.transformtransform.forward * gunRange));\n        }\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator DestroyObject(GameObject obj)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(laserDuration);\n        Destroy(obj);\n        Object = null;\n        if (Object == null)\n        {\n            GameOver();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void GameOver()\n    {\n        // Your game over logic here\n        SceneManager.LoadScene(\"GameOverScene\");\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code:\n\n- The `ShootRay()` method handles the raycasting and can be called from the `Update()` method as needed.\n- The `DestroyObject()` method is a coroutine that waits for the laser duration and then destroys the given object.\n- The `GameOver()` method is called when all objects are destroyed. It's currently set to load a \"GameOverScene\", but you'll need to replace this with your actual game over logic.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Here is the corrected code. The main problem was the improper placement of the `Destroy(hit.transform.gameObject);` and `Object = null;`. I moved these lines to `ShootLaser()` method and called it when the player presses 'K'. For the GameOver function, I added an if statement that checks if the 'Object' is null. If it is, the game is over. \n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.SceneManagement;\n\n[RequireComponent(typeof(LineRenderer))]\npublic class RaycastGun : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public Camera playerCamera;\n    public Transform laserOrigin;\n    public GameObject Object;\n    private bool isPlayerOnObject = false;\n    public GameObject player;\n    public float gunRange = 50f;\n    public float fireRate = 0.2f;\n    public float laserDuration = 0.05f;\n \n    LineRenderer laserLine;\n    float fireTimer;\n\n    AudioManager audioManager;\n    public List<GameObject> destroyObject; // List of objects to destroy\n\n    void Awake()\n    {\n        laserLine = GetComponent<LineRenderer>();\n        audioManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(\"Audio\").GetComponent<Aud><ioMa><nager>();\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (isPlayerOnObject)\n        {\n            fireTimer += Time.deltaTime;\n            if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.K) && fireTimer > fireRate)\n            {\n                fireTimer = 0;\n                ShootLaser();\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (Object == null)\n        {\n            GameOver();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void ShootLaser()\n    {\n        laserLine.SetPosition(0, laserOrigin.position);\n        Vector3 rayOrigin = playerCamera.ViewportToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0));\n        RaycastHit hit;\n        if (Physics.Raycast(rayOrigin, playerCamera.transform.forward, out hit, gunRange))\n        {\n            if (hit.collider.gameObject == Object)\n            {\n                audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.swordSound);\n                laserLine.SetPosition(1, hit.point);\n                audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n                Destroy(hit.transform.gameObject);\n                Object = null;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                laserLine.SetPosition(1, rayOrigin + (playerCamera.transform.forward * gunRange));\n            }\n        }\n        StartCoroutine(ShootLaser());\n    }\n\n    void GameOver()\n    {\n        // Code to handle game over\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator ShootLaser()\n    {\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(laserDuration);\n        laserLine.SetPosition(0, Vector3.zero);\n        laserLine.SetPosition(1, Vector3.zero);\n    }\n}\n```\nEnsure that your `AudioManager` script is set to play the correct sounds and you have the correct tag for the `Audio` GameObject in your scene.",

The Update() method has also been simplified and is now only responsible for handling the shooting of the raycast and the activation of GameOver if the objective is null (gone)."
