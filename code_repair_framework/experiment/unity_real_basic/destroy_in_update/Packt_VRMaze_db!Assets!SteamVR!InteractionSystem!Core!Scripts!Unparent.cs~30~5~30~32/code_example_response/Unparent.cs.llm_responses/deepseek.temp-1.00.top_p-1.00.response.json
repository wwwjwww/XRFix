This ensures that the object is destroyed only when `oldParent` is not set to `null`. Otherwise, the object will be destroyed every frame.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The buggy code causing the object to be destroyed in the update method is not allowed in Unity. Instead, we should use `Object.Destroy()` or use `GameObject.SetActive(false)`.

However, this was done within the `Update()` method, which gets called every frame. While this might technically work in this context, it's considered an inefficient approach and potentially more prone to problems, especially in larger and more complex projects. \n\nTherefore, the code has been moved to `Update()`, which is only called when the game object loses its parent or when it has been set to inactive by the engine. This has a better overall performance and is considered the better practice in Unity."
