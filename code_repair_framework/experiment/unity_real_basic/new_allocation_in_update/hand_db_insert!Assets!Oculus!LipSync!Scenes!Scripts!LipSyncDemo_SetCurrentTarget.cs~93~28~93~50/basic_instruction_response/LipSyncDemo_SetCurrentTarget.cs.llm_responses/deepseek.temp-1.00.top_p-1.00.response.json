    "code_repairing_0": "Your Unity code has a couple of problems. The first one is a bug in the OnEnable() method of the LipSyncContextMorphTarget class, which has a New() allocation. The second problem is with the SetCurrentTarget() method.\n\nIn the OnEnable() method, you should use List.Add() to add the current GameObject to the list, like so:\n\n```C#\nprotected override void OnEnable()\n{\n    if (Application.isPlaying)\n    {\n        List.Add(gameObject);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNext, we look at the SetCurrentTarget() method. It seems to operate with a List variable 'SwitchTargets'. If you haven't defined the List, you may need to do so:\n\n```C#\nList<EnableSwitch> SwitchTargets = new List<EnableSwitch>();\n```\n\nThen, when setting the current target, you should be setting the active game object as follows:\n\n```C#\nSwitchTargets[targetSet].SetActive(this.gameObject);\n```\n\nPlease note, these are assumptions based on your provided information. If the SetCurrentTarget() method isn't defined, or if the 'SwitchTargets' variable isn't defined, you may need to define them accordingly. Also, the correct Unity method to use when activating game objects is SetActive(true), not <T>(), so make sure to adjust the SetActive method call accordingly.",

    "code_repairing_2": "Your provided code has a couple of issues which are making the code less efficient. First, you're creating a new List<InputDevice> in the Update() method. This is probably not what you want to do because this list will be empty until the Update() method is finished, then it will contain all of the input devices. Instead, you should create the list once at the start of the method, and then modify it as needed in the method. \n\nHere is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nIList<InputDevice> inputDevices = new List<InputDevice>();\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    // Update device list\n    InputDevices.GetDevices(inputDevices);\n\n    foreach (InputDevice inputDevice in inputDevices)\n    {\n        // Use inputDevice...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe other potential issue in your code is with the XRButtonBeingPressed variable. It is not being set to true or false anywhere in your code, so its value will not change. If you need to track the state of a button, you need to add the relevant code that changes the value of XRButtonBeingPressed.",
    "code_repairing_3": "You're on the right track in understanding the potential performance issue with creating a new resource every frame (in your Update() method). To correct this, you should move the List<InputDevice> creation outside of Update(). Here is a revised version of your code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class LipSyncDemo_SetCurrentTarget : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public EnableSwitch[] SwitchTargets;\n\n    private int targetSet = 0;\n    private int maxTarget = 6;\n    private bool XRButtonBeingPressed = false;\n\n    private List<InputDevice> inputDevices = new List<InputDevice>(); // moved this line from Update()\n\n    void Start ()\n    {\n        OVRTouchpad.AddListener(LocalTouchEventCallback);\n        targetSet = 0;\n        SwitchTargets[0].SetActive<OVRLipSyncContextMorphTarget>(0);\n        SwitchTargets[1].SetActive<OVRLipSyncContextMorphTarget>(0);\n    }\n\n    void Update ()\n    {\n        // Check for input...\n        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha1))\n        {\n            targetSet = 0;\n            SetCurrentTarget();\n        }\n        // ... and other key presses\n    }\n\n    void SetCurrentTarget()\n    {\n        InputDevices.GetDevices(inputDevices);\n        SwitchTargets[targetSet].SetActive<OVRLipSyncContextMorphTarget>(0);\n    }\n\n    void LocalTouchEventCallback(int index, bool pressed)\n    {\n        // Handle touchpad button presses...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you'll only create the `inputDevices` list once per frame rather than every frame. However, be aware that because this list is only created once, it will not be refreshed between frames. If you need to refresh this list at each frame, you will need to re-create it in the Update method.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you're trying to use the Oculus SDK's function `OVRTouchpad.AddListener(LocalTouchEventCallback)` to listen for touchpad events. However, there are a couple of things I need to clarify:\n\n1. What is `LocalTouchEventCallback`? It should be a function that defines what should happen when an event occurs on the touchpad.\n\n2. The code provided seems to be incomplete or incorrect. I cannot see the full context or the goal of your code. If you provide more context or clarify your goal, I could assist you better.\n\n3. Your code seems to be using Unity 2019.1 or newer check, but you didn't provide the correct method to check if the game is running on Unity 2019.1 or later. You can use `Application.version` to get the Unity version and then compare it to your requirement(s) to check. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nstring versionString = Application.version;\nint[] versionArray = versionString.Split('.').Select(int.Parse).ToArray();\n\nif (versionArray[0] >= 2019) // Check if Unity version is 2019 or newer\n{\n    // Do something\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance."
