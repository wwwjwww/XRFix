This is inefficient as it leads to memory allocation in each frame. Moving the allocation outside of the `Update()` method can improve performance.",
    "code_repairing_2": "You're correct, it's bad practice to allocate new resource in Update() method. Instead, it would be better to handle this when a new event is added. Here is your fixed code:\n\n```csharp\n\nDictionary<int, float> toRecord = new Dictionary<int, float>();\n\n// in your Update function\nvoid Update() {\n    lock (_recordLock) {\n      if (toRecord.Keys.Count > 0) {\n        foreach (KeyValuePair<int, float> entry in toRecord) {\n          // Spawn Timeline event\n          activeEvents[entry.Key] = _deviceInterface.SpawnTimelineEvent(entry.Key, new Vector2(entry.Value, entry.Value + .01f));\n\n          // Remove record after it is added to activeEvents\n          toRecord.Remove(entry.Key);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nThe issue was related to allocating new resources in the Update method, which could potentially be causing performance issues as it was called on every frame. This fixed code should handle the allocation after the new event is added to the activeEvents dictionary. Please note that you should call `toRecord.Remove(entry.Key);` to prevent duplication in the dictionary.",

    "code_repairing_4": "The buggy line in your code is inside the `Update()` method. The bug is related to performance and it's creating a new `timelineEvent` object each frame which is not necessary and inefficient. You should be using the existing `timelineEvent` objects instead of creating new ones. \n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    playheadScrubbing = playheadHandle.curState == manipObject.manipState.grabbed;\n\n    if (!playheadScrubbing) updatePlayhead();\n    else {\n        playheadHandle.xBounds.y = _deviceInterface._gridParams.UnittoX(_deviceInterface._gridParams.head_tail.x);\n        playheadHandle.xBounds.x = _deviceInterface._gridParams.UnittoX(_deviceInterface._gridParams.head:ht_tail.y);\n        curGridPosition = _deviceInterface._gridParams.XtoUnit(playheadHandle.transform.localPosition.x);\n        timelineEventUpdate();\n    }\n\n    lock (_recordLock) {\n        if (toRecord.Keys.Count > 0) {\n            foreach (KeyValuePair<int, float> entry in toRecord) {\n                // Get existing timelineEvent from activeEvents if it exists, else create it\n                if (!activeEvents.ContainsKey(entry.Key)) {\n                    activeEvents[entry.Key] = _deviceInterface.SpawnTimelineEvent(entry.Key, new Vector2(entry.Value, entry.Value + .01f));\n                } else {\n                    // Update existing timelineEvent\n                    activeEvents[entry.Key].pos = new Vector2(entry.Value, entry.Value + .01f);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this corrected code, if a `timelineEvent` with the same key exists in `activeEvents`, it will update the `pos` property of the existing `timelineEvent`. Otherwise, it creates a new `timelineEvent` with the same key. This way, we avoid unnecessary object creation and improve the performance of the code."
