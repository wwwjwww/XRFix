    "code_repairing_3": "Here's the fixed code snippet you requested:\n\n```\n[Bug] Using New() allocation in Update() method.\n[MESSAGE] Update() method is called each frame. It's inefficient to allocate new resource using New() in Update() method.\n\n// FIXED CODE:\n\nactiveEvents[entry.Key] = _deviceInterface.SpawnTimelineEvent(entry.Key, new Vector2(entry.Value, entry.Value + 0.01f), false);\n```\n\nIn the previous code, the `SpawnTimelineEvent` method was called in the `Update` method, which is not recommended as it allocates a new object every frame. Instead, you should create the object once and reuse it.\n\nThe fixed code snippet uses the `new` keyword to create a new object of type `Vector2` and passes it as an argument to the `SpawnTimelineEvent` method. The `false` argument is used to indicate that the object should not be recorded.\n\nNote that you should make sure to only reuse objects that are no longer needed and can be safely disposed of. In this case, the `timelineEvent` object is not needed after it's added to the `activeEvents` dictionary, so it can be safely disposed of.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The code is using the `New()` method to allocate a new `timelineEvent` instance in the `Update()` method. This is not recommended as it can lead to performance issues and fragmentation.\n\nInstead, consider using the `Get` or `GetOrCreate` method to retrieve an existing `timelineEvent` instance, or the `Spawn` method to create a new one and then attach it to the `activeEvents` dictionary. This approach can help reduce the memory usage and improve the performance of the game.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the code to use the `GetOrCreate` method:\n```\nDictionary<int, timelineEvent> activeEvents = new Dictionary<int, timelineEvent>();\n\n...\n\nvoid updatePlayhead() {\n  if (_deviceInterface._gridParams.isOnGrid(curGridPosition)) {\n    playheadHandle.gameObject.SetActive(true);\n    Vector3 pos = playheadHandle.transform.localPosition;\n    pos.x = _deviceInterface._gridParams.UnittoX(curGridPosition);\n    playheadHandle.transform.localPosition = pos;\n  } else playheadHandle.gameObject.SetActive(false);\n\n  lock (_recordLock) {\n    activeEvents.GetOrCreate(n).Update(curGridPosition);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis way, you can retrieve or create a `timelineEvent` instance for the current grid position, and update it accordingly. If you need to create a new `timelineEvent` instance, you can use the `Spawn` method to create a new one and then attach it to the `activeEvents` dictionary.\n\nIt's important to note that the `updatePlayhead` method is being updated to use the `GetOrCreate` method, which returns an already existing `timelineEvent` instance if the specified key is found, or creates a new one if it does not exist. This is the more efficient way to retrieve or create the `timelineEvent` instance."
