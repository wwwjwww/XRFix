    "code_repairing_2": "Here are the fixed snippets of code under the 'FIXED CODE:' area:\n\n1. In the `Awake()` method, the `GetComponent<Light>()` method is used to get a reference to the light component attached to the object.

Therefore, it is necessary to check if the returned value is not `null` before using it.\n\n```csharp\nvoid Awake()\n{\n    m_transform = transform;\n    m_initial_Rotation = m_transform.rotation.eulerAngles;\n    m_initial_Position = m_transform.position;\n\n    Light light = GetComponent<Light>();\n    if (light != null)\n    {\n        m_lightColor = light.color;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_lightColor = Color.black;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. In the `Update()` method, the `Mathf.Sin()` method is used to calculate the sine of the time value and multiply it by the rotation range. However, this method returns a value between -1 and 1.

This ensures that the rotation is within the desired range. Additionally, the `y` position was reset to `10` as it was previously set to `0f`.\n\nThe original code had the following line:\n```\nm_transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(m_initial_Rotation.x, Mathf.Sin(m_time) * RotationRange + m_initial_Rotation.y, m_initial_Rotation.z);\n```\nHowever, this line was setting the `rotation` of the object to be a sine wave with a range of `0` to `RotationRange` degrees, which is not what the code was intended to do. The fix is to use the multiplication operator to multiply the sine wave by `RotationRange` to get the actual range of rotation.\n\nThe other minor changes were made to ensure that the object does not move indefinitely on the `x` axis, and the `y` position was reset to `10`.",

The `m_prevPOS` field was removed, as it was not used in the original code.\n2. The logic for the `Update` method was corrected to follow the rules of the Unity Engine. The original code was using `Mathf.Sin(m_time)` to calculate the rotation of the object, but this was incorrect. Instead, the corrected code uses `Mathf.Sin(m_time * 0.95f)` to smoothly transition between the initial rotation and the destination rotation.\n3. The `m_initial_Rotation` field was renamed to `m_initial_Position` to reflect its new usage.\n4. The `float x`, `float y`, and `float z` variables were removed because they were not used in the corrected logic.\n5. The `Awake` method was corrected to initialize the `m_transform` field with the `transform` property of the component, rather than the `transform` property of the game object. This is consistent with the Unity Engine architecture."
