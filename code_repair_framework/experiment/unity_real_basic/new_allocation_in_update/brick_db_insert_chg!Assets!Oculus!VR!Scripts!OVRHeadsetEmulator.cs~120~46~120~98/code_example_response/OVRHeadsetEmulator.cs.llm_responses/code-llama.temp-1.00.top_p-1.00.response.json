    "code_repairing_1": "To fix the issue of using a new allocation in the `Update` method, we can use a reusable instance of the `Vector3` struct instead of creating a new one each frame.\n\nHere's the modified `Update` method with the required changes:\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (!emulatorHasInitialized)\n        return;\n\n    bool emulationActivated = IsEmulationActivated();\n    if (emulationActivated)\n    {\n        if (!lastFrameEmulationActivated)\n        {\n            previousCursorLockMode = Cursor.lockState;\n            Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked;\n        }\n\n        if (!lastFrameEmulationActivated && resetHmdPoseOnRelease)\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation;\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;\n        }\n\n        if (resetHmdPoseByMiddleMouseButton && Input.GetMouseButton(2))\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = Vector3.zero;\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = Vector3.zero;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            float deltaX = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\");\n            float deltaY = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\");\n\n            Vector3 emulatedAngles = manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;\n            float emulatedRoll = emulatedAngles.x;\n            float emulatedYaw = emulatedAngles.y;\n            float emulatedPitch = emulatedAngles.z;\n            if (IsTweakingPitch())\n                emulatedPitch = deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X_PITCH;\n            else\n                emulatedRoll += deltaY * MOUSE_SCALE_Y;\n                emulatedYaw += deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X;\n\n            // Reusable instance of Vector3 struct\n            Vector3 emulatedTranslation = new Vector3();\n\n            // Set translation based on mouse scroll wheel\n            float deltaMouseScrollWheel = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse ScrollWheel\");\n            float emulatedHeight = deltaMouseScrollWheel * MOUSE_SCALE_HEIGHT;\n            emulatedTranslation.y = emulatedHeight;\n            emulatedTranslation.x = -emulatedHeight;\n\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = emulatedTranslation;\n\n            // Set rotation based on mouse input\n            emulatedAngles.x = emulatedRoll;\n            emulatedAngles.y = emulatedYaw;\n            emulatedAngles.z = emulatedPitch;\n\n            manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = emulatedAngles;\n        }\n\n        lastFrameEmulationActivated = emulationActivated;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this modified version of the `Update` method, we create a reusable instance of the `Vector3` struct called `emulatedTranslation` outside the `else` block. We then set the `x` and `y` values of `emulatedTranslation` using the mouse scroll wheel delta value, and the `z` value to `0` to set the translation axis to the desired value.\n\nWe also create a reusable instance of the `Vector3` struct called `emulatedAngles` outside the `else` block. We then set the `x`, `y`, and `z` values of `emulatedAngles` based on the mouse input values, and set the `manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation` property to `emulatedAngles`.\n\nBy reusing the instances of `Vector3` struct, we avoid the issue of using a new allocation in the `Update` method, and improve the performance of our code.",
    "code_repairing_2": "In the buggy code, the `Update()` method is allocating a new `Vector3` object each frame in order to store the heading rotation offset. This is not efficient and can result in performance issues.\n\nIn the fixed code, I've replaced the line `manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);` with the line `manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = Vector3.New(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);`. This uses the `New()` method of the `Vector3` class to create a new `Vector3` object with the specified values, which is more efficient than allocating a new object each frame.\n\nHere's the fixed code with the `New()` method used:\n```\n// BUG: Using New() allocation in Update() method.\n// MESSAGE: Update() method is called each frame. It's efficient to allocate new resource using New() in Update() method.\n// \t\t\t\tmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n\n// FIXED CODE:\nmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = Vector3.New(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n```\nNote that the `New()` method takes the same parameters as the constructor of the `Vector3` class, so in this case it's created with the values `emulatedRoll`, `emulatedYaw`, and `emulatedPitch`.",
