    "code_repairing_1": "You can create a new Vector3 object with the updated rotation values and assign it to the headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation property of the OVRManager instance.\n\nmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n\nThis way, you avoid creating a new Vector3 object on every Update call, which should be more efficient. \n\nKeep in mind to limit pitch and roll to a certain range so that players can't look too far up or down.\n\nYou may also want to consider adding checks to ensure that the editor build is always on when you switch to a build configuration that isn't set to 'EditorOnly' in the inspector. This will ensure that the headset emulator won't interfere with the gameplay during normal running.\n\nHere's the complete Fix:\n\n```csharp\nif (lastFrameEmulationActivated && !emulationActivated)\n{\n    Cursor.lockState = previousCursorLockMode;\n}\n\nif (emulationActivated)\n{\n    if (!lastFrameEmulationActivated)\n    {\n        previousCursorLockMode = Cursor.lockState;\n        Cursor.lockState = CursorLockMode.Locked;\n    }\n\n    if (!lastFrameEmulationActivated && resetHmdPoseOnRelease)\n    {\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation;\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;\n    }\n\n    if (resetHmdPoseByMiddleMouseButton && Input.GetMouseButtonDown(2))\n    {\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = Vector3.zero;\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Vector3 emulatedTranslation = manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation;\n        float deltaMouseScrollWheel = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse ScrollWheel\");\n        float emulatedHeight = deltaMouseScrollWheel * MOUSE_SCALE_HEIGHT;\n        emulatedTranslation.y += emulatedHeight;\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = emulatedTranslation;\n\n        float deltaX = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\");\n        float deltaY = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\");\n\n        Vector3<emulatedAngles = manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;\n        float emulatedRoll = emulatedAngles.x;\n        float emulatedYaw = emulatedAngles.y;\n        float emulatedPitch = emulatedAngles.z;\n        if (IsTweakingPitch())\n        {\n            emulatedPitch += deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X_PITCH;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            emulatedRoll = Mathf.Clamp(emulatedRoll + deltaY * MOUSE_SCALE_Y, -MAX_ROLL, MAX_ROLL);\n            emulatedYaw += deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X;\n        }\n\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3<>(emulatedRoll, emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n    }\n}\n\nlastFrameEmulationActivated = emulationActivated;\n}\n```",
    "code_repairing_2": "The code you posted seems to have been cut off. However, I can provide a complete solution, assuming that you're trying to set the headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation using a Vector3. Here's the code snippet:\n\n```csharp\n\t\t\t\tVector3 newEmulatedRotation = new Vector3(Mathf.Clamp(emulatedRoll, -MAX_ROLL, MAX_ROLL), emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n\t\t\t\tmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = newEmulatedRotation;\n```\n\nThis code will limit the roll angle between -85 and 85 degrees. You can adjust `MAX_ROLL` variable as per your requirements. \n\nNote that `Clamp` is used to limit the rotation angle between the minimum and maximum values. This ensures that the roll angle does not exceed the valid range.\n\nAlso, please ensure that the OVRManager is properly initialized and the necessary components are enabled in your Unity project.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Please find the fixed code below:\n\n```csharp\n\t\t\t\tVector3 newEmulatedRotation = new Vector3(Mathf.Clamp(emulatedRoll, -MAX_ROLL, MAX_ROLL), emulatedYaw, emulatedPitch);\n\t\t\t\tmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3(newEmulatedRotation.x, newEmulatedRotation.y, newEmulatedRotation.z);\n```\n\nThis code creates a new Vector3 with the clamped roll value and the existing yaw and pitch values, which are assigned to `manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation`. This way, you are avoiding the memory allocation problem that you mentioned. \n\nAlso, you're using a public enum to define the different operational modes for your emulator, which could be useful for different game or application development. Make sure to implement the switch statement to handle these modes properly in your `Update()` method.\n\n```csharp\npublic enum OpMode\n{\n    Off,\n    EditorOnly,\n    AlwaysOn\n}\n```\n\nFor the OpMode, you could add this switch statement:\n\n```csharp\nswitch (opMode)\n{\n    case OpMode.Off:\n        // Do nothing\n        break;\n    case OpMode.EditorOnly:\n        if (Application.isEditor)\n            emulationActivated = true;\n        break;\n    case OpMode.AlwaysOn:\n        emulationActivated = true;\n        break;\n}\n```\n\nThis code switches on the current opMode and sets `emulationActivated` accordingly. If the OpMode is `OpMode.EditorOnly`, the emulator will only activate if the application is running in the editor. If the OpMode is `OpMode.AlwaysOn`, the emulator will activate regardless of the application's context.\n\nRemember to call `LastFrameEmulationActivated(emulationActivated)` at the end of your `Update()` method to update the `lastFrameEmulationActivated` field.\n\n```csharp\npublic void LastFrameEmulationActivated(bool emulationActivated)\n{\n    this.lastFrameEmulationActivated = emulationActivated;\n}\n```\n\nLastly, to properly reset the HMD pose when the application is released, you could add an `OnApplicationFocus` method:\n\n```csharp\nvoid OnApplicationFocus(bool hasFocus)\n{\n    if (!hasFocus && resetHmdPoseOnRelease)\n    {\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation;\n        manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will reset the HMD pose whenever the application loses focus. This could be useful in a situation where you run the application in full screen mode.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Based on your code block, I saw there was a potential bug. In the last line, it was suggested to create a new Vector3 object for `manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation` every frame when using `Input.GetAxis()`. This could potentially cause performance issues as a new object is created every frame. \n\nA better approach would be to create the object once and reuse it across frames, instead of creating a new object each time. If you are using a language that supports value types (like C#), you could potentially create a struct for managing the rotation (like for example `RotationData`), which could be reused across frames. \n\nHowever, if it's not possible to change the rotation value on the fly, you could just assign to the existing object. Here's a revised version of your code with the suggested changes:\n\n```csharp\n// Assuming a struct \"RotationData\" was created with properties \"Roll\", \"Yaw\", and \"Pitch\"\nRotationData emulatedRotation = new RotationData(manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation);\nfloat deltaX = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\");\nfloat deltaY = Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\");\n\nif (IsTweakingPitch())\n{\n    emulatedRotation.Pitch += deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X_PITCH;\n}\nelse\n{\n    emulatedRotation.Roll += deltaY * MOUSE_SCALE_Y;\n    emulatedRotation.Yaw += deltaX * MOUSE_SCALE_X;\n}\n\nmanager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = new Vector3(emulatedRotation.Roll, emulatedRotation.Yaw, emulatedRotation.Pitch);\n```\n\nThis ensures that a new object isn't created every frame, which should help maintain performance."
