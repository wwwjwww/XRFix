    "code_repairing_0": "It seems your code is inefficient and violating the Unity recommendation. The list `deadList` is created in the `Update()` method using `New()`, which is creating new memory allocation on each frame. To resolve this, you can create this list before the `Update()` method in the `Start()` or at the class level. You can also use `Lists.Pool` if you're using Unity 2018.4 or later which provides a pool system for reusing objects. Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\nprivate List<PacketLatencyPair> deadList = new List<PacketLatencyPair>();\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    LocalAvatar.RecordPackets = true;\n    LocalAvatar.PacketRecorded += OnLocalAvatarPacketRecorded;\n    float FirstValue = UnityEngine.Random.Range(LatencySettings.FakeLatencyMin, LatencySettings.FakeLatencyMax);\n    LatencySettings.LatencyValues.AddFirst(FirstValue);\n    LatencySettings.LatencySum += FirstValue;\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (packetQueue.Count > 0)\n    {\n        deadList.Clear(); // Clear the deadList\n        foreach(var packet in packetQueue)\n        {\n            // Process each packet in packetQueue\n            //...\n            deadList.Add(packet); // Add to deadList after processing\n        }\n\n        foreach(var dead in deadList)\n        {\n            packetQueue.Remove(dead); // Remove from packetQueue\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you're only allocating memory once per frame at the start of the `Update()` method, and you're reusing the same list to clear and add items to, which is much more efficient than constantly allocating new memory.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like you're trying to allocate a new list in the method `Update()`. This is not a recommended practice. Allocating memory in a frequent method like `Update()` could lead to performance issues as it incurs continuous memory allocation and deallocation. The allocation can pile up leading to a memory leak. \n\nIf you need to keep a list of PacketLatencyPair objects, a better approach would be to initialize this list at the start of your `RemoteLoopbackManager` class. Then allocate memory only when necessary, for example when packets are received and added to the list. After that, you can manage the memory allocation and deallocation at your own discretion. \n\nHere is an example:\n\n```cs\npublic class RemoteLoopbackManager : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ...\n\n    private List<PacketLatencyPair> packetList = new List<PacketLatencyPair>();\n\n    // ...\n\n    void OnLocalAvatarPacketRecorded(object sender, OvrAvatar.PacketEventArgs args)\n    {\n        // ...\n        \n        AddPacketToList(outputStream.ToArray());\n    }\n\n    private void AddPacketToList(byte[] data)\n    {\n        PacketLatencyPair newPacket = new PacketLatencyPair()\n        {\n            PacketData = data,\n            FakeLatency = LatencySettings.NextValue()\n        };\n        \n        packetList.Add(newPacket);\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a new PacketLatencyPair object and adds it to 'packetList' when a packet is received. The PacketLatencyPair object is allocated only when necessary (when a packet is received), reducing memory allocation overhead in the Update method. \n\nRemember that if your 'packetList' grows to be very large, you will need to handle memory deallocation and potential memory leaks to prevent your program from using up all the available memory.",
    "code_repairing_2": "List<PacketLatencyPair> deadList = new List<PacketLatencyPair>();\n\n            foreach (PacketLatencyPair pair in packetQueue)\n            {\n                if (packetQueue.Count == 0)\n                {\n                    break;\n                }\n                \n                if (!IsLocalPacket(pair.PacketData))\n                {\n                    deadList.Add(pair);\n                }\n\n                packetQueue.Remove(pair);\n\n                if (pair.PacketData != null)\n                {\n                    if (pair.FakeLatency > 0)\n                    {\n                        StartCoroutine(SendWithLatency(pair.PacketData, pair.FakeLatency));\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        LoopbackAvatar.QueuePacket(pair.PacketData, 0);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            foreach (PacketLatencyPair pair in deadList)\n            {\n                packetQueue.Remove(pair);\n            }\n\n            deadList.Clear();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private bool IsLocalPacket(byte[] data)\n    {\n        int sequenceNumber = BitConverter.ToInt32(data, 0);\n        return sequenceNumber == --PacketSequence;\n    }\n\n    private void SendPacketData(byte[] data)\n    {\n        PacketLatencyPair pair = new PacketLatencyPair();\n        pair.PacketData = data;\n        pair.FakeLatency = LatencySettings.NextValue();\n        packetQueue.AddLast(pair);\n    }\n\n    private IEnumerator SendWithLatency(byte[] data, float latency)\n    {\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(latency);\n        LoopbackAvatar.QueuePacket(data, 0);\n    }\n}",
    "code_repairing_3": "Move the allocation of the `deadList` to before the `Update` method has been called, or reuse an existing heap allocation if possible. Here's how you can do this:\n\n```csharp\nList<PacketLatencyPair> deadList = new List<PacketLatencyPair>();\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    // ... your code and logic\n    // when packets should be removed from the queue\n    foreach (var item in packetQueue)\n    {\n        deadList.Add(item);\n    }\n\n    foreach (var item in deadList)\n    {\n        packetQueue.Remove(item);\n    }\n\n    deadList.Clear();  // Optional: clear the list after use\n}\n```\n\nThis way, you allocate the `deadList` once before the `Update` method, and you reuse it across multiple calls to `Update`. This should help you reduce the number of allocations/deallocations that occur each frame. I understand that this isn't a perfect solution when dealing with latency, but it reduces the number of allocations to a manageable level, which would otherwise become a performance issue.",
