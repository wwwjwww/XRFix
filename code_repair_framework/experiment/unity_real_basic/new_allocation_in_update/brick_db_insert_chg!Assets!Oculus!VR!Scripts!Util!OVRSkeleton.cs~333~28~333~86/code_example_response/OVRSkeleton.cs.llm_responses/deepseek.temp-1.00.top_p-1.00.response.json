    "code_repairing_1": "In the first provided code segment, the variable `mList` needs to be declared at a class level because it is being used outside of the `Update()` method. The fixed code is `List<string> new_mList = new List<String>();`. Then, inside the `Update()` method, you would replace `mList = new_mList`.\n\nIn the second provided example, the bug here is the allocation of a new Vector3 each frame in the Update() method. The message suggests to move this to a static or persistent object so it's not called every frame. The fix is to remove or comment the line of code with the bug. If you want to dynamically change the localScale based on some data in another script or object, you can do that. \n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n'''\npublic class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    List<string> new_mList = new List<string>();\n    \n    void Update()\n    {\n        mList = new_mList;\n        //transform.localScale = new Vector3(data.RootScale, data.RootScale, data.RootScale);\n    }\n}\n'''\n\nPlease replace 'data' with your actual data object for root scale. Also, remember that the commenting of the buggy code is up to your discretion. You might want to keep it for learning or debug purposes.",

It's a good practice to update the object properties in the Update function, the Unity Update method is called once per frame and is used for performing actions that need to be performed constantly over time.",
