    "code_repairing_0": "The issue you're facing is that you're instantiating a new resource every frame in the Update method. This is a performance issue and can lead to unnecessary memory usage. One way to fix this is by reusing a StringBuilder instance instead of creating a new one each frame.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nprivate StringBuilder m_builder; // Declare a StringBuilder instance at class level\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    m_builder = new StringBuilder(); // Instantiate the StringBuilder once\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    m_builder.Length = 0; // Clear the StringBuilder before using\n    m_builder.Append(label);\n    m_builder.Append(m_frame % 1000);\n\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(m_builder.ToString());\n    \n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, a StringBuilder instance is created in the Start method and reused in the Update method to concatenate and set the text. The StringBuilder.Length property is used to ensure that the StringBuilder is cleared before it is used.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Here's the fixed code for your case:\n\n```C#\n[SerializeField] private float arg0;\n[SerializeField] private float arg1;\n[SerializeField] private float arg2;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, arg0, arg1, arg2);\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n```\n\nThe new code takes the arguments for the SetText method into the Update method, fixing the issue of constant allocation of new resources. This solution assumes that the arguments `arg0`, `arg1` and `arg2` are constant and won't change during the lifetime of the component. If the values of these variables need to change at runtime, you will need to update them accordingly in the Update method.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, I can help you with that. The issue you're describing is about having non-allocated resources used in the Update() method, which could potentially consume more memory and CPU power over time. \n\nIn your code, the `m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, m_frame % 1000);` line is called in the Update() method, which means the SetText method can be called multiple times per second. Using `new()` in this context could lead to memory allocation and deallocation per frame, which could be inefficient.\n\nInstead, one way to fix this would be to store the formatted string in a variable before calling the SetText method, which would then only happen if the string has changed. Here's a simple example:\n\n```csharp\nstring formattedText;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    formattedText = string.Format(label, m_frame % 1000);\n}\n\nvoid LateUpdate()\n{\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(formattedText);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the string is formatted once per frame in the Update method. Then, the SetText method is called only once per frame in the LateUpdate method, avoiding unnecessary resource allocation. \n\nRemember, you should use the LateUpdate() method if you need to access other game objects or components that are updated in the same frame, but you need to use data from this frame. If you only need to update the UI once per frame you can use Update().",
    "code_repairing_3": "```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class SimpleScript : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public TextMeshPro textMeshPro;\n    private float m_frame;\n    private float arg0, arg1, arg2;\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        m_frame += Time.deltaTime;\n        if(m_frame >= 1000)\n        {\n            m_frame = 0;\n        }\n        textMeshPro.SetText(label, (int)m_frame, arg0, arg1, arg2);\n    }\n}\n```\nThe bug in the provided code is that `m_frame` is being calculated inside the `Update()` method, which is called every frame. This means the TextMeshPro's text is being updated every frame. If this is not desired behavior, consider moving it to another place within your game loop. \n\nAlso, it seems like the `SetText` method in `TMP_Text` expects additional arguments in your original code. You need to provide the necessary numbers for each argument, else your program will throw an exception.\n\nIn the fixed version of the code, I've added a frame counter to `m_frame`. This will allow you to limit the rate at which you update the text. Also, the arguments are set but their values are not provided in your code. So, you need to provide the correct arguments values.",
    "code_repairing_4": "In your original code, you're trying to call a function `SetText` from a component every frame in the `Update()` method. This could be causing memory allocation per frame, which could lead to performance issues. \n\nTo optimize this, you should instead make sure that this function is only called when the text needs to be updated, or when the parameters that it takes have changed. \n\nHowever, without knowing the complete context, I can only suggest a general approach. If you're using Unity's `MonoBehaviour`, you might consider using a coroutine for the `SetText` call, and then using a bool flag to determine when to stop the coroutine:\n\n```csharp\npublic bool stopCoroutine = false;\npublic string label;\npublic float arg0, arg1, arg2;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (!stopCoroutine)\n    {\n        StartCoroutine(SetTextCoroutine());\n    }\n    m_frame += 1 * Time.deltaTime;\n}\n\nIEnumerator SetTextCoroutine()\n{\n    stopCoroutine = true;\n    m_textMeshPro.SetText(label, m_frame % 1000, arg0, arg1, arg2);\n    yield return null;\n    stopCoroutine = false;\n\n}\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that `SetText` is only called every frame until the coroutine is stopped. \n\nPlease adjust this example to suit your specific needs. The most important part is that you should only call expensive methods (like `SetText`) when needed (ie when they actually need to be updated). If it's not changing, you don't need to call it every frame."
