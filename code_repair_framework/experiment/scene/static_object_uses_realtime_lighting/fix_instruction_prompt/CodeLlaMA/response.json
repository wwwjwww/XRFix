The code snippet describes a Unity scene file, which contains a light object with a \"m_Lightmapping\" property set to 4, indicating that it is using real-time lighting.\n\nTo fix the bug, you need to change the \"m_Lightmapping\" property to \"baked lighting\" by setting it to 1. Here is the updated code snippet:\n\n'''\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n'''\nThis will fix the bug of resource consumption for static objects using real-time lighting, and the light object will now use baked lighting instead of real-time lighting."
