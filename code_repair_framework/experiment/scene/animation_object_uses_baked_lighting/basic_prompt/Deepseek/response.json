    "code_repairing_0": "The 'm_Lightmapping' setting is set to 2 meaning \"Realtime\" instead of \"Baked\". \n\nTo fix this:\n'''\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 0\n'''\nThe setting should be '0', which represents \"Baked\".",
    "code_repairing_1": "The 'm_Lightmapping: 2' setting in YAML likely corresponds to 'Subtractive / Shadow' in inspector under baking settings in Unity. This setting will effectively disable baked light for the animation object. Here's the fixed code snippet for you:\n\n```yaml\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 0\n```",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems you have a setting for using baked lighting, but there is no mention of animation object. In order to fix it, you need to specify that the animation object should not use baked lighting. Here is the corrected part of your code:\n\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n  ...\n  bakedGI: false\n```\n\nThe `bakedGI: false` line ensures that the animation object will not use baked lighting.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The setting under the 'FIXED:' area could be changed to use 'Animation Objects Use Animated Lighting' like this:\n\n```\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n```\n\nIn Unity, the 'm_Lightmapping' setting can be either 1 (Animation Objects Use Animated Lighting) or 2 (Use Baked Lighting). Changing the setting to 1 should fix the bug of Animation Objects using baked lighting.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Since this bug is more related to graphic rendering rather than programming, it's not possible to solve this problem directly with code. \n\nHowever, I can tell you that in Unity, the 'Lightmapped' property on an object determines whether the object's surface properties are lit using baked lighting. It essentially reduces the overhead of real-time lighting calculations during runtime, which can be good for large levels or objects. But for animation objects, this might not be the best approach because they usually change frequently. \n\nIn theory, you should use 'Dynamic' while having the script controlling the animations for the objects, and 'Mixed' if the animation cannot be influenced by the light settings but has complex geometry and/or texture changes.\n\nBear in mind that the optimal setting would depend on the specific use case. If you are using a lighting setup with shadow casting objects, it may not be optimal to use baked lighting. It\u2019s recommended to make and test tests to find out which is the optimal configuration."
