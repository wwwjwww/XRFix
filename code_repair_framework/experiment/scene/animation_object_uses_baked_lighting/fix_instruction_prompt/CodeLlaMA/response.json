    "code_repairing_0": "The YAML file you provided contains a bug in the \"Light\" section, specifically in the \"m_Lightmapping\" field. The bug is caused by using the value \"2\" for \"m_Lightmapping\", which is set to \"baked\". This is not optimal for animation objects, as it means that the object will use baked lighting, which is not suitable for animations.\n\nTo fix this bug, you should change the value of the \"m_Lightmapping\" field to \"real-time\". This will tell Unity to use real-time lighting for the object, which is better suited for animations.\n\nHere is the fixed code snippet:\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: real-time\n```\nThis code will fix the bug by changing the value of \"m_Lightmapping\" to \"real-time\", which is the correct setting for animation objects.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Sure, I can help you with that. The bug in the YAML code is in the animation object's lighting settings, specifically in the \"m_Lightmapping\" parameter. The value is currently set to \"2\", which means that baked lighting is being used.\n\nTo fix this bug, we need to change the value of \"m_Lightmapping\" to \"0\", which means \"real-time\" lighting.\n\nHere's the fixed code snippet:\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 0\n```\nNote that this fix assumes that the \"Light\" object contains the \"m_Lightmapping\" parameter as shown in the code snippet. If the parameter is located somewhere else or has a different name, you may need to adjust the code accordingly.",
