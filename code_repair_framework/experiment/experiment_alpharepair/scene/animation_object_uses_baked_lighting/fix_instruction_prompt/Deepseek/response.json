The code you're sharing seems to be related to a specific software or tool and may not be suitable for general programming assistance. However, if you're looking for ways to debug or optimize your Unity scenes, it's probably worth looking into optimization techniques and optimizing your lighting setup.",
    "code_repairing_1": "I'm sorry for the confusion, but the given YAML code snippet doesn't seem to be related to Unity animator or lighting settings which might result in a misunderstanding. I may misunderstood your question before. However, you should know that this operation should be done in a text editor rather than a YAML parser. Unity's settings are usually stored in .asset files using Unity's scriptable object serialization, and changing these values requires knowledge of C# or other scripting languages that can interact with Unity.\n\nPlease provide a clear and more contextualized question, or a properly formatted Unity scene file, so I can give the more accurate and helpful response.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here's the fixed YAML code snippet:\n\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n```\n\nThis change sets the \"m_Lightmapping\" setting to \"1\" for real-time lighting.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Here is the corrected YAML snippet:\n\n```yml\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 0\n```\n\nIn this scene, the lighting settings are set to 'baked lighting' (value 2). In Unity, 'real-time lighting' is set to value 0. So, the bug is fixed by setting the 'm_Lightmapping' to real-time lighting.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Here is the fixed code:\n\n```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 0\n```\n\nIn Unity, 'm_Lightmapping' value of '2' stands for 'Baked Lighting'. Changing it to '0' means setting it to 'Real-Time Lighting'. After this change, your animation object should use real-time lighting."
