    "code_repairing_0": "I have found the bug in your Unity scene file. The correct syntax for YAML is:\n\n'''\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n'''\nThis code snippet will fix the bug by disabling real-time lighting for the static object and instead use lightmapping.",
    "code_repairing_1": "To fix this issue, you can set the Light mapping option to \"None\" in the Scene Manager. This will turn off real-time lighting for the static object.\n```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: None\n```\nThis will reduce the resource consumption of the static object.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug is that the `m_Lightmapping` field is set to `4`, which is not a valid value for the `Light` component in Unity. The `m_Lightmapping` field is used to store the lightmapping resolution for the light, and it should be set to a valid value.\n\nTo fix the bug, you can change the value of `m_Lightmapping` to a valid value. For example, you can set it to `Lightmapping.Realtime`, which is a valid value for the `Light` component.\n```\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: Lightmapping.Realtime\n```\nThis will fix the bug and use real-time lighting for the light.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The code you provided is in YAML format, which is a data serialization language used for storing and sharing data. Here's the fixed code for the 'Light' section:\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 0\n```\nIn the original code, the 'm_Lightmapping' property was set to '4', which indicates that real-time lighting is enabled for the static object. However, this can be a performance-consuming issue, as the static object is using real-time lighting.\n\nIn the fixed code, the 'm_Lightmapping' property is set to '0', which indicates that real-time lighting is disabled for the static object. This should reduce the resource consumption for the static object.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The bug is caused by the setting `m_Lightmapping` to 4, which is causing the resource consumption to increase for static objects using real-time lighting. To fix this, you can change the setting to 0, which will disable real-time lighting for static objects.\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 0\n```\nThis will fix the resource consumption issue and reduce the impact of the bug."
