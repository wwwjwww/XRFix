    "code_repairing_0": "It looks like you're trying to implement a manager for rendering placed bricks. However, your code is missing the implementation of some methods and structures that this class will need. Here's an example of what you might need to fill in the gaps:\n\n```csharp\npublic class PlacedBrickRendererManager : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private static PlacedBrickRendererManager _instance;\n    public static PlacedBrickRendererManager GetInstance()\n    {\n        if (_instance == null)\n        {\n            _instance = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\"PlacedBrickRendererManager\")\n                ?.GetComponent<PlacedBrickRendererManager>();\n        }\n        return _instance;\n    }\n\n    public Material brickMaterial;\n\n    private readonly Dictionary<Mesh, MeshRenderBucket> _meshToRenderBuckets = new Dictionary<Mesh, MeshRenderBucket>();\n    private readonly LinkedList<MeshToRender> _brickUuidToNodes = new LinkedList<MeshToRender>();\n    private readonly Dictionary<string, Mesh> _brickUuidToMesh = new Dictionary<string, Mesh>();\n\n    private class MeshRenderBucket\n    {\n        public readonly LinkedList<MeshToRender> instances = new LinkedList<MeshToRender>();\n\n        public Mesh mesh;\n        public Material material;\n\n        public MeshRenderBucket(Mesh mesh, Material material)\n        {\n            this.mesh = mesh;\n            this.material = material;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private class MeshToRender\n    {\n        public string uuid;\n        public Mesh mesh;\n        public Material material;\n\n        public MeshToRender(string uuid)\n        {\n            this.uuid = uuid;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Your methods would go here. For example, a method to add bricks might look like this:\n\n    public void AddBrick(string uuid, Mesh mesh, Material material = null)\n    {\n        if (material == null)\n        {\n            material = brickMaterial;\n        }\n\n        MeshRenderBucket bucket;\n        if (!_meshToRenderBuckets.TryGetValue(mesh, out bucket))\n        {\n            bucket = new MeshRenderBucket(mesh, material);\n            _meshToRenderBuckets.Add(mesh, bucket);\n        }\n\n        var node = _brickUuidToNodes.AddLast(new MeshToRender(uuid)\n        {\n            mesh = mesh,\n            material = material\n        });\n\n        _brickUuidToNodes.Add(uuid, node);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this code is just an example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.",
