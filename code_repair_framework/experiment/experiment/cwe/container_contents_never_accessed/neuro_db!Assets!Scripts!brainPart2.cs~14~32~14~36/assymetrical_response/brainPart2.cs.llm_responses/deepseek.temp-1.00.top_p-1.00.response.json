    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you're trying to set up a script that will manage a specific behavior in Unity, but your code isn't finished. The rest of your code has not been provided. However, based on the provided code, here are some pointers:\n\n1. `private Vector3 originalPos;` - This is used to store the position of the game object at the start of the game or when it is reset.\n2. `public static TextMesh text;` - This suggests that the script should be managing a TextMesh object. If it's a static reference, there should be one in your scene that it can reference.\n3. `private bool isThisRed = false;` and `private bool inTransition = false;` - These are used to track the game object's state and a transition state for some operation.\n\nThese are very generic descriptions without a specific task to accomplish. If you could provide more specific instructions or a task you're trying to accomplish, I might be able to help you with your script.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It appears you're writing a C# script for a Unity project, possibly related to a \"brain\" or \"gene\" game. The script is named \"brainPart2\" and it's designed to control the movement of a \"brain\" object in a 3D scene. \n\nThe variables set up in this script include:\n- `originalPos`: a Vector3 storing the object's original position.\n- `text`: probably TextMesh is used for showing text on the screen. You might have TextMesh attached to other gameObjects, named it this way but it's not properly set for this script to run.\n- `isThisRed`: a boolean to check whether this brain part is currently red.\n- `inTransition`: a boolean to check if the brain part is currently in a transition or not.\n\nHowever, there are no methods or scripts in this given code block. \n\nLet me know what specific functionality you want to see in this script, so I could help further.",

    "code_repairing_3": "Your code is missing the method that it needs to work. You've created the basics, but need to define what should happen when the script is called. \n\nHere is a basic example of how you could define something for the script:\n\n```csharp\npublic class brainPart2 : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private Vector3 originalPos;\n    public static TextMesh text;\n\n    private bool isThisRed = false;\n    private bool inTransition = false;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        // Store the original position of the object\n        originalPos = transform.position;\n        \n        // Assume that there is a TextMesh on the same gameObject with a reference to it\n        text = GetComponent<TextMesh>();\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        // Check for user input and move the object or whatever you need\n        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))\n        {\n            StartCoroutine(MoveObject());\n        }\n    }\n\n    IEnumerator MoveObject()\n    {\n        if (!inTransition)\n        {\n            inTransition = true;\n            \n            // This will wait 1 second before continuing\n            yield return new WaitForSeconds(1f);\n            \n            // Move to a new position\n            transform.position = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);\n            \n            // Change the color of the object if it's not already red\n            if (!isThisRed)\n            {\n                isThisRed = true;\n                GetComponent<Renderer>().material.color = Color.red;\n            }\n            \n            // Change the text of the TextMesh component\n            text.text = \"Hello, world!\";\n\n            // Reset inTransition\n            inTransition = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis script will find a `TextMesh` component on the same gameObject and set its text to \"Hello, world!\" when you press the space key. It will also move the gameObject on its y-axis to (0, 0, 0) and change its color to red if it's not already. It won't do anything if it's already in the middle of a transition. \n\nRemember, the DG.Tweening library (which is used in the example code) is only used for its `WaitForSeconds` method which is also available in Unity's built-in functions. To use DOTween, you need to import it in your Unity project from the Unity Asset Store or Github page.",
