We can add these initializations as shown below.\n\n```csharp\nclass Composers\n{\n    IList<string> names = new List<string>(), genres = new List<string>();\n```\n\nThis would fix the issue. However, from the original code, it's not clear what the exact issue is with the container of contents. An additional context or more specific information on the bug could lead to a more precise solution.\n\nIf you meant to have the buggy code line you can add it as:\n```csharp\n'''\nIList<string> names = new List<string>(), genres = new List<string>(); // names and genres are initialized here\n'''\n```\nThis line is not directly a problem, but if `names` and `genres` are not used as intended, we should consider it to be a bug.",
