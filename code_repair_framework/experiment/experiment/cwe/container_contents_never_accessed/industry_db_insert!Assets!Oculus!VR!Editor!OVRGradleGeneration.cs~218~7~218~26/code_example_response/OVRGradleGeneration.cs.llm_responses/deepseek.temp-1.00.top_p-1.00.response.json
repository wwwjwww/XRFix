This list is never accessed in the provided code, which is a waste of memory. The list can be moved to a better location where it will be used. Please provide the context in which this list is used for a more accurate fix.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like you want to fix the 'var targetOculusPlatform = new List<string>();' declaration, which isn't being accessed anywhere in your code. In the original code, the variable isn't used at all, so it can be safely removed or commented out. So, the 'FIXED CODE:' should look like this:\n\n'''\n// FIXED CODE:\n// var targetOculusPlatform = new List<string>();\n'''",
    "code_repairing_4": "'''\nvar targetOculusPlatform = new List<string>();\n''' \nFaulty code in the original is a variable declaration which has no function or use. The fixed code adds the declaration and utilizes it into an empty List instance."
