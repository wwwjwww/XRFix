    "code_repairing_0": "The bug here is that the list `allScenesInProject` is never used or accessed anywhere in the code. Therefore, it is unnecessary to have it defined as it will not provide any benefits and can be removed.\n\n```csharp\npublic static bool FindScene(string sceneName, out Scene scene, out int sceneIndex)\n{\n    scene = default(Scene);\n    sceneIndex = -1;\n\n    // FIXED CODE:\n    // List<Scene> allScenesInProject = new List<Scene>();\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCountInBuildSettings; i++)\n    {\n        allScenesInProject.Add(SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i));\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < allScenesInProject.Count; i++)\n    {\n        if (GetSceneNameFromScenePath(allScenesInProject[i].path) == sceneName)\n        {\n            scene = allScenesInProject[i];\n            sceneIndex = i;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\nThis version of the code removes the unused `allScenesInProject` variable and populates it with the scenes in the build settings via the `SceneManager.GetSceneAt` method. After that, it searches the list of scenes for the one with the matching name and returns the corresponding scene and index if found.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Here is the fixed code:\n\nIt seems that the container is unnecessary. I removed the declaration of allScenesInProject:\n\n```csharp\npublic static bool FindScene(string sceneName, out Scene scene, out int sceneIndex)\n{\n    scene = default(Scene);\n    sceneIndex = -1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCount; i++)\n    {\n        sceneIndex = i;\n        scene = SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i);\n        if (scene.name == sceneName)\n        {\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nNow, the function FindScene iterates through all the scenes in the build settings (SceneManager.sceneCount) and checks if the scene at the current index has the same name. If it does, it sets the output parameters scene and sceneIndex to these values and returns true. If it doesn't find the scene, it returns false.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The buggy line in your code is:\n\n```csharp\n// BUG: Container contents are never accessed\nList<Scene> allScenesInProject = new List<Scene>();\n```\n\nThe corrected code is:\n\n```csharp\n// FIXED CODE:\nList<Scene> allScenesInProject = new List<Scene>(SceneManager.GetAllScenes());\n```\n\nThis change retrieves all the scenes in the current active scene and stores them in the `allScenesInProject` list.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The bug is that the list of all scenes in the project is never queried or accessed, which is useless because it's not used anywhere in the code. It can be removed.\n\n```C#\npublic static bool FindScene(string sceneName, out Scene scene, out int sceneIndex)\n{\n    scene = default(Scene);\n    sceneIndex = -1;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < SceneManager.sceneCount; i++)\n    {\n        if (GetSceneNameFromScenePath(SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i).path) == sceneName)\n        {\n            scene = SceneManager.GetSceneAt(i);\n            sceneIndex = i;\n            return true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThe buggy code here is only returning one item from the list (the last one) when the function FindScene() is called but no such item is ever specified. The fixed version of the code goes through each item in the list, compares it to the sceneName parameter, and if they match, assigns that item to the scene variable and its index to sceneIndex. It then returns true to indicate that the scene was found. If no match is found in the entire list, the function returns false. This ensures the correct Scene object is returned even in the case where multiple scenes match the given name.",
