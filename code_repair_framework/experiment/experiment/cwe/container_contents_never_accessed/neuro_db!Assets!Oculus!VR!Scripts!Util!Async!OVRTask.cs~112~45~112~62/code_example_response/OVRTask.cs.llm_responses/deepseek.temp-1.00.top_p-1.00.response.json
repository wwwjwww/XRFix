This part of the code is redundant and seems to be unused, as no methods or properties in the containing class are using the SubscriberClearers HashSet. \n\nHere is the corrected code without the 'SubscriberClearers' part:\n\n```csharp\n// Fixed Code:\n\nprivate static readonly HashSet<Action> SubscriberClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n\nprivate delegate bool InternalDataRemover(Guid guid);\n\nprivate static readonly Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover> InternalDataRemovers =\n    new Dictionary<Guid, InternalDataRemover>();\n\nprivate static readonly HashSet<Action> InternalDataClearers = new HashSet<Action>();\n\nprivate static readonly Dictionary<Guid, Action<Guid>> SubscriberRemovers =\n    new Dictionary<Guid, Action<Guid>>();\n```\n\nAlso, ensure to review and test the rest of your code.
