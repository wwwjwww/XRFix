    "code_repairing_0": "The code you provided appears to be incomplete. It seems to be missing the part where you are trying to handle the rooms found and display them in the UI. \n\nHowever, without more specific code, I can give you a general idea of how to proceed. \n\nHere is a basic structure of how this could be done:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void InitializeSavedRoomsList()\n{\n    string[] rooms = FindSaves();\n    savedRooms = new GameObject[rooms.Length];\n\n    if(rooms.Length <= 0) {\n        RenderNoSavedRooms();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < rooms.Length; i++) {\n        // Load the room data from each save file\n        // Deserialize the data to a room object or a data container\n        RoomData roomData = LoadRoom(rooms[i]);\n\n        // Instantiate the prefab for each room and store a reference in the array\n        savedRooms[i] = Instantiate(recentRoomPrefab, savedRoomsObject.transform);\n\n        // Set the text of the room code, name and brick count on the instantiated GameObject\n        recentRoomsRoomCodes[i].text = roomData.roomCode;\n        recentRoomsNames[i].text = _textInfo.ToTitleCase(roomData.roomName.ToLower());\n        recentRoomsBrickCounts[i].text = roomData.brickCount.ToString();\n    }\n\n    RenderSavedRoomsList();\n}\n```\nIn the code above, `RoomData` is a placeholder for your room data class. You would need to implement it yourself. This code assumes that `recentRoomsRoomCodes`, `recentRoomsNames`, and `recentRoomsBrickCounts` are populated with UI text elements in the same order as your rooms. \n\nPlease provide more context or the `RoomData` class if you need more specific help.",
    "code_repairing_1": "The issue occurs because the collection `roomNamesToLoad` is never queried or accessed. Since the collection is never read from, you can remove or comment out the declaration of the collection. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```C#\nprivate void InitializeSavedRoomsList()\n{\n    string[] rooms = FindSaves();\n\n    if(rooms.Length <= 0) {\n        RenderNoSavedRooms();\n        return;\n    }\n\n    //Remove or Commented-out the collection if it is no longer needed\n    //List<string> roomNamesToLoad = new List<string>();\n\n    if (_initializedSavedRoomsList == false)\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < rooms.Length; i++)\n        {\n            //Create new room objects and initialize their properties from save data\n            GameObject roomObject = Instantiate(recentRoomPrefab, savedRoomsObject.transform);\n            RoomProperties roomProperties = roomObject.GetComponent<RoomProperties>();\n\n            roomProperties.roomCode.text = _textInfo.ToTitleCase(Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(rooms[i]));\n            roomProperties.roomName.text = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(rooms[i]);\n\n            roomProperties.roomCode.text = _textInfo.ToTitleCase(Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(rooms[i]));\n\n            savedRooms[i] = roomObject;\n        }\n\n        _initializedSavedRoomsList = true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis fix should eliminate the warning message and ensure that the contents of the `roomNamesToLoad` collection are never queried or accessed.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug you are facing is a potential memory leak. The warning is suggesting that you have a collection or map whose contents are never queried or accessed and thus, are not useful. In your code, it seems like you are creating a new `List<string>` named `roomNamesToLoad`, but you aren't using it anywhere.\n\nIf you are using these room names for something else and need them at some point, you should use `roomNamesToLoad` by calling the `.ToArray()` method to convert the `List<string>` to an array of strings and then use that array anywhere you need. \n\nHere's the unneeded `List<string>`:\n\n```csharp\nList<string> roomNamesToLoad = new List<string>();\n```\n \nHere's the new array you can use where needed:\n\n```csharp\nstring[] rooms = roomNamesToLoad.ToArray();\n```\n\nRemember that it's a good practice to avoid creating new unused collections to avoid unnecessary memory usage. Be sure that `rooms` variable is being used for something meaningful in your code.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It sounds like the code is trying to handle a situation where there are no saved rooms. The comment suggests that a certain collection is not being used or accessed. It is important to note that Unity doesn't actually have the ability to detect when a variable is not being used in a project. However, one way to try and detect this is by reviewing the project periodically or using a tool like ReSharper from JetBrains, which automates the process. The provided solution is using Linq to filter out the files that don't have the \".bricks\" extension.

Please replace the path and the data structure in this code according to your project needs.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The problem you're experiencing is related to a situation where the data inside a collection is never accessed, causing no use or wasted resources.

But if you do need this collection, you might want to use it to store and access the data you need. Here's an example of how you might use it:\n\n```csharp\nList<string> roomNamesToLoad = new List<string>();\n\n// Add room names to the list\nroomNamesToLoad.Add(\"Room 1\");\nroomNamesToLoad.Add(\"Room 2\");\n\n// Then you can access the data later on\nstring firstRoomName = roomNamesToLoad[0];\n```\n\nThe `roomNamesToLoad` list above has been used, and it will store the names of rooms. If you can provide more context on how you plan to use this data, I might be able to give a more accurate solution."
