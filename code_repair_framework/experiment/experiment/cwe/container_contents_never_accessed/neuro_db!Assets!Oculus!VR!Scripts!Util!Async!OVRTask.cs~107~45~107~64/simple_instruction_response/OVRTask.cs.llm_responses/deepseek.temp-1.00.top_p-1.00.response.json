    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you want to continue some code but you didn't provide it. My apologies for that. However, your code is incomplete and I can only guess what you might be trying to do. It appears to be part of a task-based system where `OVRTask` is used for managing tasks of specific types (`TResult`). \n\nIf you have any specific questions about this code or if you need help with a specific part of it, could you please provide more information?",
    "code_repairing_1": "This part of your code seems to be incomplete and doesn't contain the complete solution. You are trying to set up callbacks for OVRTask objects. However, it seems that you have not posted the complete solution. Please provide the complete solution for the code you posted and I can help you with it.\n\nFor example, it might be a class or a method with a body, but it's not entirely visible from what you've posted.\n\nMoreover, you seem to have a lot of private fields and methods with no corresponding public interfaces. This would lead to some confusion and potential breaking changes.\n\nFinally, the use of `unchecked` is not recommended and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. So if you can refactor this code to make it more efficient and safe, that would be great!",

    "code_repairing_3": "It seems you have shared a piece of code which seems to be about an OVRTask class. However, your code is incomplete and missing several parts, including some methods that were intended to be public (like `SetResult`, `AddToPending`, etc.). \n\nThe code you've shared appears to be a part of a larger system, with the OVRTask being a core component. It is likely managing tasks in a way that is specific to that system, as well as handling callbacks, continuations, and internal data management.\n\nThe shared code is in C# and seems to be part of an open-source application. If you could provide the rest of the code or if you have a specific question related to this code, I'd be able to assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you are trying to implement a kind of \"Future\" or \"Promise\" using C#. This is a commonly used pattern in asynchronous programming to represent a value that will be available in the future.\n\nThe code you've provided appears to be a part of a larger context, and not a complete, standalone solution. The incomplete code includes a number of methods related to creating, getting, and managing OVRTask instances. OVRTask is a generic struct that represents a task of a specific type `TResult`.\n\nThe methods you've provided allow for the creation and retrieval of OVRTask instances. For instance, `OVRTask.FromGuid<TResult>(Guid id)` creates a task with a given Guid as an identifier. Similarly, `OVRTask.FromResult<TResult>(TResult result)` creates a task that has already been resolved to a value.\n\nAlso, the code provides functionality for setting the result of a task, adding tasks to pending, getting existing tasks, and dealing with callbacks related to these tasks.\n\nHowever, the code is incomplete and seems to be using internal structures that are not defined anywhere in the provided code. It seems like it's part of a large system and there may be other missing or incomplete parts. If you can provide a more complete context or specific questions about the code, I might be able to provide a more detailed response."
