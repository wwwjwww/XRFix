    "code_repairing_0": "This is a Unity script for voice recognition and lip-sync with Oculus software. It inherits from `OVRLipSyncContextBase`. The script includes several configurable parameters like `enableKeyboardInput`, `enableTouchInput`, `audioLoopback`, `gain`, and `showVisemes`.\n\nThe script has a `Start()` function that subscribes to touchpad events if `enableTouchInput` is true. It also checks if an `OVRLipSyncDebugConsole` exists and sets `hasDebugConsole` accordingly.\n\nThe `Update()` function handles keyboard input if `enableKeyboardInput` is true. It includes several options, such as toggling `audioLoopback`, `showVisemes`, calculating and displaying gain, and debugging laughter score.\n\nThe `PreprocessAudioSamples()` function receives audio data and modifies it by multiplying it with the `gain` value.\n\nThe `PostprocessAudioSamples()` function modifies audio data by setting it to zero if `audioLoopback` is false.\n\nIn short, this script is used to control voice recognition and lip sync in a Unity application with Oculus software.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It appears you've posted a section of a C# script for a Unity project. This script appears to be related to audio processing and lip sync in a virtual reality (VR) context using the Oculus SDK. It's named `OVRLipSyncContext` and extends `OVRLipSyncContextBase`. This script has several public variables related to different behaviors and user controls. \n\nThe script also includes methods for handling keyboard inputs, audio processing, and debugging. \n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further explanation about this script, feel free to ask!",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you have posted a part of a Unity script for Oculus Voice SDK (OVRLipSync). This script inherits from a base class OVRLipSyncContextBase and configures the Oculus device to perform lip sync based on the audio input.\n\nHowever, I noticed you're using a few specific keys (such as KeyCode.L, KeyCode.D, KeyCode.H, KeyCode.LeftArrow, KeyCode.RightArrow) for controlling the script. If you're not aware, KeyCode is an enumeration that represents the physical key on a US keyboard that is mapped to a Unity action. \n\nFor example, KeyCode.L maps to the 'L' key on your keyboard, KeyCode.D maps to the 'D' key, and so on. These key codes are used for controlling the script in the function `HandleKeyboard()`. If you want to use these keys for different actions, you should check the rest of your script to make sure that other parts of it are using the right key codes.\n\nPlease verify whether these changes will affect your existing behaviors and take appropriate measures if necessary. If you need more specific help, please provide more context or specific questions.",

    "code_repairing_4": "It looks like you have a script for lip synchronization using the Oculus VR library in Unity. This script extends `OVRLipSyncContextBase` and is intended to be used with mono audio source.\n\nHere is what every part of your code does:\n\n1. The `HandleKeyboard` function checks for keyboard inputs and handles them accordingly. It includes handlers for looping back audio, toggling viseme scores display, toggling laughter score display, and adjusting the linear audio gain.\n\n2. The `PreprocessAudioSamples` function modifies the audio samples before processing by scaling the audio data by the gain.\n\n3. The `PostprocessAudioSamples` function modifies the audio samples after processing. If `audioLoopback` is set to false, it mutes (scales the audio data to 0) the audio.\n\n4. The `DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter` function is not shown in your code snippet. It seems to be meant to display the viseme and laughter scores in the OVRLipSyncDebugConsole if `showVisemes` and `showLaughter` are true.\n\n5. The `Start` function adds a listener for touch events if `enableTouchInput` is true.\n\n6. The `Update` function is constantly checking for keyboard inputs and updating the `laughterScore` and viseme scores.\n\nRemember, Unity's audio input needs to be passed through the `ProcessFrame` function in order for the lip-sync to work. \n\nThis code looks pretty comprehensive and complete, given that you haven't shown the `DebugShowVisemesAndLaughter` method. Please provide it to make the complete picture."
