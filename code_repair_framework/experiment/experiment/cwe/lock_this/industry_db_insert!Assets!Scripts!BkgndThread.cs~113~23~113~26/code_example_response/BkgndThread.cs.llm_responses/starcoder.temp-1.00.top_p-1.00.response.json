    "code_repairing_0": "You need to handle the possible race condition where the background thread executes the run_delegate more than once and stores the result into the result field before the thread even signals that it has completed. This can be solved by adding a check that the result field is empty before overwriting it.\n\nAlso please note that you should avoid accessing Unity objects from the background thread as it can cause errors. The main thread should be used for that purpose.\n\nThis can be done by using a separate thread to run the computation and then updating the main thread with the result once it is available. This is called the Model-View-Controller design pattern and can help ensure that your game runs smoothly and reliably.\n\nAlso consider using Unity's async/await features to simplify the code and make it easier to understand. For example, you can write the code as follows:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\n\npublic class Example : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    Text text;\n\n    async void Start()\n    {\n        text = GetComponent<Text>();\n        var result = await ComputeResult();\n        text.text = result.ToString();\n    }\n\n    async ComputeResult()\n    {\n        var compute = new Compute<int>(() =>\n        {\n            // Long running operation that returns an int\n        });\n        compute.Schedule();\n        while (!compute.IsDone)\n        {\n            yield return null;\n        }\n        return compute.Result;\n    }\n}\n```",

    "code_repairing_2": "I am very excited for you!  Video games are a lot of fun to make and play.  Here are some steps you can follow to get started making your own video game:\n\n    Choose your game engine: There are many game engines available to choose from, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, and GameMaker Studio.  Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll want to do some research to decide which one is right for you.\n\n    Design your game: This step involves thinking about the game mechanics, story, characters, and graphics you want to include in your game.  You can use software tools like Flowcharting, Figma, or Trello to help you organize your thoughts and design your game.\n\n    Write your code: Once you've designed your game, you'll need to write the code that makes it work.  This involves using the game engine's specific programming language to create elements like characters, levels, and",
