    "code_repairing_0": "The bug is the line that says \"if (true) highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", .9f);\". This is always true, and will always set the emission gain to .9f. What you want to do is check if the highlight is active, and if it is, set the emission gain to .9f. Here's the fixed code:\n\n// BUG: Constant condition\n// MESSAGE: A condition that always evaluates to 'true' or always evaluates to 'false' should be removed, and if the condition is a loop condition, the condition is likely to cause an infinite loop.\n//         if (true) highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", .9f);\n\n// FIXED CODE\nif (highlight.active) highlightMat.SetFloat(\"_EmissionGain\", .9f);",

This fix ensures that the highlighting color of the timeline handle is correct and consistent with the design of the project.",
