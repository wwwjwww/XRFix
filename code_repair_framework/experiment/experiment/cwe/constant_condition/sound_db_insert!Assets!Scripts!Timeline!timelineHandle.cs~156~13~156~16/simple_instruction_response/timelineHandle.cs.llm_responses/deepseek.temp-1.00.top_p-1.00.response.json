    "code_repairing_0": "I'm sorry, but your query got cut off before the continuation of the code. However, I can't fully understand your question. It seems you are implementing a timeline handling feature in Unity3D, but you haven't mentioned what specifically you're not understanding or running into trouble. Could you provide some more context or clarify your problem? It would be helpful to understand how you're trying to implement this feature and where you're running into issues.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It appears you've partially pasted a Unity script, and you're asking about the part of the script that is incomplete. It seems you forget to comment the code or write details of what this incomplete part should do. \n\nThe incomplete part of your code currently is:\n\n```\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (curState == manipState.grabbed && state != manipState.grabbed) {\n      _timelineEvent.grabbed = false;\n      if (stretchMode) stretchMode = false;\n\n      _timelineEvent.transform.position = highlight.transform.position;\n      _timelineEvent.transform.rotation = highlight.transform(_transform.rotation;\n\n      highlight.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;\n      highlight.transform.localRotation = Quaternion.identity;\n\n      _timelineEvent.transform.parent = timelineTransform;\n      _timelineEvent.recalcTrackPosition();\n\n      _timelineEvent.toggleEdges(true);\n\n      _timelineEvent.overlapCheck();/// = false;\n    }\n\n    curState = state;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide further details about this incomplete part of the code or add more context so I can assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_2": "It seems like you are trying to complete the rest of the code, but I didn't notice a question. If you have a specific question related to this code, I can help with that! For instance, you might want to know how to complete this class, add new functionality, or solve a bug. Could you please clarify your question?",
    "code_repairing_3": "I see that you are trying to fix a piece of code that seems to be missing the final closing bracket '}' of a function definition. Could you please provide the rest of the code? I need your assistance to finish and correct the code.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like your code snippet is cut-off, but it's still a complete script. It appears to be related to a Unity Engine script. However, it's missing the closing brace for the `Update` function, which is causing a problem. Here is the corrected part:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    if (recordDesired) {\n      highlight.SetActive(recording);\n      GetComponent<Renderer>().enabled = !recording;\n      GetComponent<Collider>().enabled = !recording;\n      recordDesired = false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis completes the `Update` function, so it won't crash your program. However, it depends on the rest of your program as to what it should do. Are there any other errors in your code?"
