    "code_repairing_0": "As an automated program repair tool, I would suggest the following fix for the code under the 'FIXED CODE:' section:\n```\nMax = (int)Mathf.Max(Hand_End, 50);\n```\nExplaining the reason behind the fix, the `Max` function in the `Mathf` class returns the larger of two given `float` values. To determine the maximum value between the `Hand_End` value and `50`, we can use the `Mathf.Max` function with the two values as arguments.\n\nThe code snippet you provided contains a constant condition that always evaluates to true, which can cause an infinite loop. It is not a good practice to use constant conditions, as it may lead to unexpected behavior and errors. By using the `Mathf.Max` function instead, we can achieve the desired result without using a constant condition.",
    "code_repairing_1": "```csharp\n\t Max = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? 50 : 50,\n```\nIt seems like you have a bug in your code where the condition in the ternary operator is always `true` or `false`. This can cause an infinite loop or other undesirable behavior. To fix this issue, you can replace the condition with a constant value instead, such as `50` in this case.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, here is the fixed code:\n\n```\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic enum BoneId\n{\n\t// FIXED CODE:\n\tMax = 50,\n}\n```\n\nThe bug was fixed by replacing the condition with a constant value, `50`, which will always return the same result and avoid an infinite loop.",
    "code_repairing_3": "To fix the code with a fixed code snippet, I would change the constant condition to another calculation that does not always evaluate to `true` or `false`.\n\nThe fixed code block would look like this:\n\n```\n\tpublic enum BoneId\n\t{\n\t\t// BUG: Constant condition\n\t\t// MESSAGE: A condition that always evaluates to 'true' or always evaluates to 'false' should be removed, and if the condition is a loop condition, the condition is likely to cause an infinite loop.\n\t\t// \t\tMax = ((int)Hand_End > 50) ? (int)Hand_End : 50,\n\n\t\t// FIXED CODE:\n\t\tMax = (int)Hand_End,\n\t}\n```\nIn this, the `Hand_End` value is used for both the condition and the maximum value without the use of a constant condition.\n\nRemember, this is just one approach to resolving this type of bug in Unity Development. Your code's specific needs may warrant additional or different fixes.\n\nHowever, be aware that in the context of this code, the code's intent and purpose is unspecified. Hence, I could not provide more advice.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n\tpublic enum BoneId\n\t{\n\t\t// FIXED CODE:\n\t\tMax = ((int)Hand_End <= 50) ? 50 : (int)Hand_End,\n```"
