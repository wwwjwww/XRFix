This is because the `Move` function is using `Time.deltaTime`, which is a value that represents the time passed since the last frame, and is used to calculate the speed of the player. The `FixedUpdate` method is called once per frame, while the `FixedUpdate` method is called continuously until the end of the frame.\n\nBy moving the `Move` function to the `FixedUpdate` method, the player's movement is now calculated correctly, and the player's speed is updated according to the acceleration and deceleration values.",

The `Move()` function was called from the `Update()` method, which is not the recommended way to move objects in Unity. Instead, use the `FixedUpdate()` method, which is called every fixed timestep (usually every 50 milliseconds).\n2. The `Decelerate()` and `Boost()` functions were not properly implemented. The `speed -= deceleration * Time.deltaTime;` line was not enough to properly decelerate, as it does not take into account the maximum speed limit. So, I added a `Mathf.Clamp()` function to adjust the speed to a maximum of 50 units per second.\n3. The `reachedFinishLine` variable was not properly initialized, and the `score` variable was not properly updated after reaching the finish line.\n\nI hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."
