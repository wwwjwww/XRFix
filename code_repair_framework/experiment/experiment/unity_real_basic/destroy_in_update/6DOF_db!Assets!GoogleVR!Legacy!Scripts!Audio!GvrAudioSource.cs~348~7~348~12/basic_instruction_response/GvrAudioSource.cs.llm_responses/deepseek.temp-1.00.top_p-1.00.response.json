    "code_repairing_0": "Based on the issue you mentioned, it seems like you are trying to call Destroy method in the Update method which can cause inefficiency as it's called every frame. If you are looking to destroy the game object after some condition, you should do this in the MonoBehaviour's LateUpdate method instead. Here is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.Audio;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class GvrAudioSource : MonoBehaviour {\n    //... your code here...\n\n    private void LateUpdate() {\n        if (shouldDestroy) {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n\n    //... your other code here...\n}\n```\n\nReplace `shouldDestroy` with your own condition if you want to destroy the game object based on other conditions. Please note that you can't guarantee when LateUpdate will be called, since it depends on when the Component's Update methods are called.",
    "code_repairing_1": "```C#\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.Audio;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class GvrAudioSource : MonoBehaviour {\n    // ... other code ...\n\n    private Coroutine destroyCoroutine;\n\n    private IEnumerator DestroyAfterSeconds(float seconds) {\n        yield return new WaitForSeconds(seconds);\n        Destroy(gameObject);\n    }\n\n    public void DestroyAfter(float seconds) {\n        if (destroyCoroutine != null)\n            StopCoroutine(destroyCoroutine);\n\n        destroyCoroutine = StartCoroutine(DestroyAfterSeconds(seconds));\n    }\n\n    // ... other methods ...\n}\n```\n\nThe problem with your code is that you're destroying the object in the `Update` method, which is called every frame, which is inefficient. By moving the destruction of the object into a coroutine, you ensure that it will only happen after a specified amount of seconds. This way, it will not block other operations and can be called whenever you want to destroy the object after a certain delay. The `DestroyAfter` method starts the coroutine and stops the previous if one is already running.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here is the fixed code:\n\n```c\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.Audio;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class GvrAudioSource : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private bool shouldBeDestroyed = false;\n    \n    //... rest of your code\n    \n    public void Stop () {\n        if (audioSource != null) {\n            audioSource.Stop();\n            ShutdownSource();\n            isPaused = true;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    //... rest of your code\n    \n    private void Update() {\n        if (shouldBeDestroyed) {\n            Destroy(gameObject);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private void ShutdownSource () {\n    #if OBJECT_POOLING\n        if (id >= 0) {\n            audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.Id, -1.0f);\n            audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.ZeroOutput, 1.0f);\n            audioSource.spatialize = false;\n            GvrAudio.DestroyAudioSource(id);\n            id = -1;\n\n            shouldBeDestroyed = true; // set this to true to destroy the game object\n        }\n    #endif\n    }\n    \n    //... rest of your code\n}\n```\n\nIn the original code, the `Destroy()` function is called inside the `Update()` function, which is called every frame, which is inefficient. To fix this, I have moved the `Destroy()` call to the end of the `Update()` function and added a boolean flag `shouldBeDestroyed`, which is set to `true` in the `ShutdownSource()` function when the audio source is shut down. In the `Update()` function, I check this flag and destroy the game object if it is `true`. This way, the `Destroy()` function is only called once per frame, improving performance.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Here's the corrected version of the script:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.Audio;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class GvrAudioSource : MonoBehaviour {\n    // ... (all other code remains same)\n\n    private bool soundPlaying = false; // New variable to track if sound is playing\n\n    public void Play () {\n        if (audioSource != null && InitializeSource()) {\n            audioSource.Play();\n            isPaused = false;\n            soundPlaying = true;\n        } else {\n            Debug.LogWarning (\"GVR Audio source not initialized. Audio playback not supported \" +\n                            \"until after Awake() and OnEnable(). Try calling from Start() instead.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // ... (all other methods remain same except for update() method)\n\n    private void Update() {\n        if (soundPlaying) {\n            if (!audioSource.isPlaying) {\n                soundPlaying = false;\n                ShutdownSource();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Update method is inefficiently used to check if the sound is still playing on every frame. I've added a new boolean variable \"soundPlaying\" to track if the sound is actually playing. In the Play method, I set \"soundPlaying\" to true. In the Update method, I've added a check to stop the sound from being checked until it's actually stopped.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.Audio;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class GvrAudioSource : MonoBehaviour {\n    private bool shouldDestroy = false;\n    \n    // Rest of your code...\n\n    public void Stop () {\n        if (audioSource != null) {\n            audioSource.Stop();\n            shouldDestroy = true; // Flag the source to be destroyed\n        }\n    }\n\n    void Update() {\n        if (shouldDestroy) {\n            ShutdownSource();\n            isPaused = true;\n            Destroy(gameObject); // Destroy game object instead of using Destroy()\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Rest of your code...\n    private void ShutdownSource () {\n        #if OBJECT_POOLING\n            if (id >= 0) {\n                audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.Id, -1.0f);\n                audioSource.SetSpatializerFloat((int) GvrAudio.SpatializerData.ZeroOutput, 1.0f);\n                audioSource.spatialize = false;\n                GvrAudio.DestroyAudioSource(id);\n                id = -1;\n            }\n        #endif\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code adds a flag `shouldDestroy` to the `GvrAudioSource` class. When `Stop()` method is called, `shouldDestroy` is set as true. In the `Update()` method, if `shouldDestroy` is true, the `ShutdownSource()` method is called and the game object is destroyed. This change avoids frequent calls to `Destroy()` in `Update()` method which could potentially impact performance."
