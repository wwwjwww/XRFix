    "code_repairing_0": "Based on your code, it seems like you might be trying to set the balloon to self-destruct after a certain lifetime. Instead of destroying it in the `Update` method, which is called every frame, you should destroy it in the `FixedUpdate` method, which is called at a fixed rate independent of the frame rate. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid FixedUpdate()\n{\n    if((destructTime != 0) && (Time.time > destructTime))\n    {\n        if(burstOnLifetimeEnd)\n        {\n            SpawnParticles(lifetimeEndParticlePrefab, lifetimeEndSound);\n        }\n        \n        // Destroy in FixedUpdate method\n        Destroy(gameObject);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease ensure that you have replaced the `Update()` method with the `FixedUpdate()` method in all other code sections that reference `Update()`. This will ensure the object is correctly destroyed without causing performance issues.",

This can cause performance problems especially for objects with a lot of rigidbody properties. \n\nBy only calling Destroy() once per frame (when wasUpdateCalled is true), we ensure that we are still respecting the frame rate. \n\nMoreover, by returning the object to an object pool when it is destroyed, we also ensure that we are not creating and destroying objects indefinitely. \n\nThis is a typical pattern for pooling objects in Unity. It can make a huge difference in performance for large numbers of objects.",
    "code_repairing_2": "```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n\tif (destructTime != 0 && Time.time > destructTime)\n\t{\n\t\tif (burstOnLifetimeEnd)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tSpawnParticles(lifetimeEndParticlePrefab, lifetimeEndSound);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tDestroy(gameObject);\n\t}\n}\n\nvoid OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)\n{\n\tif (collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude > maxVelocity && Time.time > lastSoundTime + soundDelay)\n\t{\n\t\tcollisionSound.PlayOneShot();\n\t\tlastSoundTime = Time.time;\n\t}\n}\n\nprivate void SpawnParticles(GameObject particlePrefab, SoundPlayOneshot sound)\n{\n\tif (!bParticlesSpawned)\n\t{\n\t\tGameObject particles = Instantiate(particlePrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\n\t\tDestroy(particles, 5f);\n\t\tbParticlesSpawned = true;\n\t\tif (sound != null)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tsound.Play();\n\t\t\ts_flLastDeathSound = Time.time;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis code will make sure the balloon is destroyed after a certain lifetime, spawn particles when lifetime ends and play a sound. It will also play a collision sound when the balloon collides with something. The `Update` method has been fixed as it is inefficient to use `Destroy` in the `Update` method. The balloon is now destroyed after it exceeds its lifetime. \n\nThe `OnCollisionEnter` method checks if the collision velocity is greater than the maximum velocity and if enough time has passed since the last sound was played before playing a collision sound.\n\nThe `SpawnParticles` method is used to instantiate the particles prefab at the balloon's position and to play the sound if one is provided. It ensures that the particles are destroyed after a certain amount of time.",
    "code_repairing_3": "```C#\n                if (!bParticlesSpawned)\n                {\n                    if (burstOnLifetimeEnd)\n                    {\n                        SpawnParticles(lifetimeEndParticlePrefab, lifetimeEndSound);\n                    }\n                    bParticlesSpawned = true;\n                }\n                if (Time.time > destructTime)\n                {\n                    if(hand!=null)\n                       hand.TriggerHapticPulse(0.25f);\n                    \n                    Destroy(gameObject, 0);\n                }\n         }\n```\nIn this revised version of the code, I've replaced the `Destroy(gameObject)` with `Destroy(gameObject, 0)`. This is because `Destroy(gameObject)` without a delay will be executed every frame until `Update()` method is called. By adding a small delay, it will be executed at most once per frame, which is much more performance-efficient.\n\nMoreover, I've added a condition `if (!bParticlesSpawned)` to ensure the lifetime end particles are only spawned once.\n\nFinally, I've added a check for `if (hand!=null) hand.TriggerHapticPulse(0.25f);`. This is to simulate a haptic feedback when the balloon lifetime ends.\n\nRemember to implement the function `SpawnParticles(prefab, sound)` which is responsible for spawning particles and play a sound, this function will not be provided here as it seems to be a specific handling based on your original code.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The update method is running every frame, which can be inefficient for long-lived objects. Instead, we should destroy the object when it exceeds its lifetime. However, I see there's a line where you destroy the game object in the update method - and this is incorrect. \n\nIf you move your Destroy to a fixed update method, the fixed update method runs at a fixed interval and can be used to handle more complex physics simulations. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```csharp\n\t\tvoid Update()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif (!bParticlesSpawned && (destructTime != 0f) && (Time.time >= destructTime))\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tif (burstOnLifetimeEnd)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tSpawnParticles(lifetimeEndParticlePrefab, lifetimeEndSound);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tbParticlesSpawned = true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tvoid FixedUpdate()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif (bParticlesSpawned)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tif ((Time.time >= destructTime) || (balloonRigidbody.velocity.magnitude > maxVelocity))\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tDestroy(gameObject);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n```\n\nThis code means that particles are now being spawned on the first update. On the fixed update, if the object has been alive for its max lifetime (or if the velocity exceeds the max velocity), the object is destroyed. This would handle the object destruction in a better way. \n\nRemember, when you move game objects, you should use the transform instead of the game object, especially when dealing with a lot of objects. \n\nAlso, you may want to add further improvements like object pooling and reducing sound spam, but that depends on your gameplay mechanics."
