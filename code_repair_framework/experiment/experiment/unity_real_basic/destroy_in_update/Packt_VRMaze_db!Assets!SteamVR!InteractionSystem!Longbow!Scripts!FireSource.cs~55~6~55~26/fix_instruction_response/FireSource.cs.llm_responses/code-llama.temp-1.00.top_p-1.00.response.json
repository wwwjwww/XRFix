The `if (fireObject != null)` check ensures that the `fireObject` is not `null`, and then the `fireObject` is destroyed using `Object.Destroy()`. This ensures that the game object is properly destroyed when the time to burn is up, and the inefficiency of calling `Destroy()` in the `Update()` method is avoided."
