    "code_repairing_2": "The method 'SpawnAndAttachAfterControllerIsTracking.Update()' has a bug, it destroys the game object after each update. This is not necessary and it's inefficient as it will cause the object to be destroyed every frame.\n\nInstead, you can try to build an object pool before the 'Update()' method has been called. Here is an example of how to do this:\n```\nvoid Start()\n{\n    hand = GetComponentInParent<Hand>();\n    // Create the object pool\n    GameObject objectToAttach = GameObject.Instantiate(itemPrefab);\n    objectToAttach.SetActive(true);\n    hand.AttachObject(objectToAttach);\n    hand.controller.TriggerHapticPulse(800);\n    // Add the object to the object pool\n    objectPool.Add(objectToAttach);\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (hand.controller != null && hand.controller.hasTracking)\n    {\n        // Check if the object is already attached\n        if (!hand.IsObjectAttached())\n        {\n            // Get an object from the pool\n            GameObject objectToAttach = objectPool.Pop();\n            // Attach the object to the hand\n            hand.AttachObject(objectToAttach);\n            // Trigger the haptic pulse\n            hand.controller.TriggerHapticPulse(800);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, the object will be created only once and it will be reused every time the 'Update()' method is called. The object pool also allows you to manage the objects more efficiently, for example you can add a limit to the amount of objects that can be in the pool, or remove old objects automatically.",
