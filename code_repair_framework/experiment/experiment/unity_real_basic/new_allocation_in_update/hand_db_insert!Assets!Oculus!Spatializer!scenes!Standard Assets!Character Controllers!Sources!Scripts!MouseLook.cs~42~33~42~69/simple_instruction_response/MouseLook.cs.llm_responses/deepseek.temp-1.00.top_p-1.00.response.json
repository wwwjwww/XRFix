It also clamps the rotation on the Y axis to the minimum and maximum values provided. Based on the selected axes, it either rotates the camera on both X and Y axes, only on the X axis or only on the Y axis.",
    "code_repairing_1": "To correct the code, the commented out line of code needs to be uncommented, since it is the one responsible for actual adjustment of the camera's rotation.\n\nThe corrected code should look like this:\n\n```csharp\ntransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, rotationX, 0);\n```\n\nThis line is responsible for rotating the gameObject (the camera by default) along the Y axis based on the mouse movements in the X axis and then fixes the rotation around the X axis based on the mouse movements in Y axis. \nSo the camera will look left and right, which is what you probably want if you're implementing camera controls. The Y axis rotation will control the up and down movements, if that's what you are looking for. And as for what this line does, it sets the individual euler angles of the gameObject. It sets x to the value of the rotationX and y to the value of the rotationY. Z stays the same (assuming you want to keep the camera rotation in the same position along the z axis). \n\nThis is assuming you want your gameObjects rotation to always match the mouse movements. If you only want to add rotation when a certain button is pressed, that needs to be added in.",
    "code_repairing_2": "This response is part of the incomplete code that you have posted, but it seems like you want to update the rotation of your transform based on mouse input. Here's the completed part of your code:\n\n```csharp\ntransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, rotationX, 0);\n\n\t\t}\n\t\telse if (axes == RotationAxes.MouseX)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttransform.Rotate(0, Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\") * sensitivityX, 0);\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\trotationY += Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") * sensitivityY;\n\t\t\trotationY = Mathf.Clamp (rotationY, minimumY, maximumY);\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ttransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, transform.localEulerAngles.y, 0);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis script will enable the camera to rotate around the character's Y axis when the \"Mouse X\" button is pressed. If you also want the rotation to occur around the character's X axis (like in first-person shooters), you can include the mouse Y axis input in a similar way.\n\nMake sure that the \"Mouse X\" and \"Mouse Y\" axes are set in your Unity Input settings to represent your mouse axes. You might need to adjust the sensitivity (how much the rotation of the camera should change per unit of mouse movement) and minimum/maximum rotation values to get the desired result.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Sure, here is the corrected portion of your code:\n\n```\ntransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(rotationY, rotationX, 0);\n```\n\nThis line is responsible for rotating the camera. It sets the local rotation of the camera to the current rotation along the X axis (which is controlled by mouse movement), along the Y axis (controlled by mouse movement, but inverted and clamped to avoid going too far up or down), and leaves the Z axis as it is.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The commented code you provided is in C# and it is fixing the rotation of the camera. It ensures that the camera will stay constrained within the specified range by using the Mathf.Clamp() function. However, the commented code is incomplete and it should be completed to ensure correct implementation. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\ntransform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, rotationX, 0);\n```\n\nThis code will make sure that the rotation around the Y axis (horizontal rotation) is always between minimumX and maximumX, and the rotation around the X axis (vertical rotation) is always between minimumY and maximumY.\n\nAlso, please remember that the UnityEngine.Input class methods like Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\") or Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") return values between -1 to 1 depending on whether the axis is positive or negative. \n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\n[AddComponentMenu(\"Camera-Control/Mouse Look\")]\npublic class MouseLook : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public enum RotationAxes { MouseXAndY = 0, MouseX = 1, MouseY = 2 }\n    public RotationAxes axes = RotationAxes.MouseXAndY;\n    public float sensitivityX = 15F;\n    public float sensitivityY = 15F;\n\n    public float minimumX = -360F;\n    public float maximumX = 360F;\n\n    public float minimumY = -60F;\n    public float maximumY = 60F;\n\n    float rotationY = 0F;\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (axes == RotationAxes.MouseXAndY)\n        {\n            float rotationX = transform.localEulerAngles.y + Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse X\") * sensitivityX;\n\n            rotationY += Input.GetAxis(\"Mouse Y\") * sensitivityY;\n            rotationY = Mathf.Clamp(rotationY, minimumY, maximumY);\n\n            transform.localEulerAngles = new Vector3(-rotationY, rotationX, 0);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis script should be attached to your Camera GameObject in your Unity Scene."
