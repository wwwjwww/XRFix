This allows us to reuse the instance and avoid the performance penalty associated with excessive allocations.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Here is the fixed code:\n\nm_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, z, y);\n\nThe issue was that the variable was not being properly initialized. Instead of using the `New()` constructor to create a new instance of `Vector3`, you can simply use the addition operator to update the position of the object.\n\nI also added the `m_time` variable to keep track of the time and calculate the new position of the object in each update.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is just one of many ways to fix the issue, and there may be other ways to improve the code.\n\nIn the next step, you will need to update the light color and the rotation of the object.",
