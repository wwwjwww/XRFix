    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like your code is incomplete and you forgot to include the full piece of code related to InputDevice. Usually, you would iterate over all connected input devices, get a device that you are interested in (maybe a button that is used to cycle between morph targets), and subscribe to its events (like pressed/released state). Here's an example:\n\n```csharp\n        List<InputDevice> inputDevices = new List<InputDevice>();\n        InputDevices.GetDevices(inputDevices);\n\n        foreach(var device in inputDevices)\n        {\n            // Add a Listener for a button press event\n            if (device.TryGetFeatureValue(CommonUsages.primaryButton, out bool primaryButtonValue) && primaryButtonValue)\n            {\n                // Subscribe to your event here. \n                Debug.Log(\"Primary button pressed\");\n            }\n        }\n```\nIn this piece of code, replace \"PrimaryButton\" with the name of your button that you're looking to listen for. You would probably want to change your \"SetCurrentTarget()\" method to be called here after a certain button is pressed.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you are working with Unity's new input system. If you're still using the old input manager, your implementation will look quite different.\n\nAdditionally, replace \"OVRTouchpad\" with the name of your touchpad input class if you're not using Oculus Utilities. If you're using Oculus Utilities, you may have a chance to use XR settings or XR settings with event system.",
    "code_repairing_1": "It seems like the code is incomplete and you have not mentioned the exact problem or need you're facing. Could you please provide more details or context about the problem? Are you getting any errors or unexpected behavior?",
    "code_repairing_2": "It appears that you've added some code that seems to be missing. If you're trying to check if an XR button is pressed, you might need to use the InputDevices.GetDevices() method. Here's a simple example:\n\n```csharp\nIEnumerable<InputDevice> devices = new List<InputDevice>();\n\ndevices = InputDevices.GetDevices();\n\nforeach (var device in devices)\n{\n    // do something with device.id, device.hand or device.TryGetFeatureValue(CommonUsages.triggerButton)\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you want to detect button presses, you might use something like this:\n\n```csharp\nInputDevices.GetDevices(devices => devices.Count > 0, devices =>\n{\n    foreach (var device in devices)\n    {\n        bool isPressed = false;\n\n        if (device.TryGetFeatureValue(CommonUsages.primaryButton, out isPressed) && isPressed)\n        {\n            // do something\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nPlease replace the parts of the code with the actual functionality you need. But keep in mind that you might need to adjust the code according to your specific setup and requirements.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The code snippet you provided seems to start with an incorrect '#if' statement and is potentially malformed. It seems like you're trying to use a syntax that is only available in newer versions of Unity. Without further context or the full content of your script, it's hard to provide a solution or the correct code.\n\nHowever, you're trying to access the value of an input device or a switch target, which sounds like you may be using either the Oculus SDK or some kind of XR-enabled character.\n\nThis code seems to be setting a variable to the index of the currently selected target, and updating it based on key presses (1-6 for target 0-5):\n\n```csharp\nif (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha1)) {\n    targetSet = 0;\n    SetCurrentTarget();\n}\n// and so on for other targetSet values...\n```\n\nThe \"SetCurrentTarget()\" method is not provided, but presumably you're calling a method that changes the active target based on \"targetSet\" or similar.\n\nThe `XRButtonBeingPressed` variable seems to be unused and not being set anywhere in the provided code. \n\nThere are other parts of the script that could use further explanation, like setting up event listeners for the touch pad or loading content in newer versions of Unity. Without these parts, I can only provide a limited understanding of the functionality of this script.",
    "code_repairing_4": "This Unity code is a C# script for a Virtual Reality (VR) project using the Oculus SDK. The script is controlling a set of targets which may correspond to different animation states in a 3D model. The targets are controlled by the user through their keypad and touchpad inputs.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. When the script is initiated, it sets the current target to the first one by default and disables all other targets.\n\n2. Then, it waits for user input on their keypad (Alpha1 to Alpha6). This corresponds to particular targets the user can switch to based on what they're currently doing.\n\n   - If a key is pressed (Any key from Alpha1 to Alpha6), it sets the targetSet variable to the corresponding number (0-5) and calls the SetCurrentTarget() method.\n\n3. The SetCurrentTarget() method is supposed to do some sort of operation to set the current target, but there is no implementation provided in this code.\n\n4. If the Escape key is pressed, the application terminates.\n\n5. There is an if statement that checks if Unity 2019.1 or newer is being used. The code inside this if statement is not provided here. It looks like it is designed to work specifically with Oculus input devices, but it is not complete.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find where the OVRTouchpad.AddListener is being used, so I can't confirm if it's meant to provide input from the touchpad or if this code is a mock-up for a future situation.\n\nBut here's an important point: This script may not work properly without additional context or more information, so ensure to check how it's being used in your project."
