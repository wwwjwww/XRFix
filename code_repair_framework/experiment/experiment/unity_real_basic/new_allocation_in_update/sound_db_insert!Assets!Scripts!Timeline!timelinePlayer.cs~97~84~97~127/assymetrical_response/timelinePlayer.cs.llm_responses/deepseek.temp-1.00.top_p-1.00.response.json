The name `_recordLock` is not defined but is referred to later with `lock(_recordLock)`. This could lead to a compilation error if it's not defined.\n\n2. `toRecord` seems to be a dictionary but it is not defined anywhere in the code you've provided.

You've not shown the full context of the `timelinePlayer` class, hence, I can't tell about the other methods (`beatUpdateEvent` etc.) in relation to these snippet you posted.\n\nPlease provide more context so I can provide a more accurate answer."
