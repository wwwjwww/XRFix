    "code_repairing_1": "It seems you have shared a piece of code that's trying to update the root pose and root scale of a skeleton. However, there's an issue with the `New()` allocation in the `Update()` method. As per Unity's best practices, `new` should generally not be used in Update or FixedUpdate methods due to efficiency reasons. Here's how you can fix this:\n\nFirstly, you should change the `Update()` method to a `FixedUpdate()` method. The `Update()` method is called every frame, while `FixedUpdate()` is called at a fixed time interval. The latter is more efficient for tasks that require precise timing, like physics calculations.\n\nSecondly, you should assign the `data.RootPose` and `data.RootScale` to localPosition and localScale of the transform respectively directly, as shown below:\n\n```csharp\nprivate void FixedUpdate()\n{\n    if (!IsInitialized || _dataProvider == null)\n    {\n        IsDataValid = false;\n        IsDataHighConfidence = false;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var data = _dataProvider.GetSkeletonPoseData();\n\n    IsDataValid = data.IsDataValid;\n    if (data.IsDataValid)\n    {\n        IsDataHighConfidence = data.IsDataHighConfidence;\n\n        if (_updateRootPose)\n        {\n            transform.localPosition = data.RootPose.Position.FromFlippedZVector3f();\n            transform.localRotation = data.RootPose.Orientation.FromFlippedZQuatf();\n        }\n\n        if (_updateRootScale)\n        {\n            transform.localScale = new Vector3(data.RootScale, data.RootScale, data.RootScale);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, you are not creating a new Vector3 every frame or using new() allocation in Update() method.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, looks like the code you shared is incomplete and there is an issue with updating the root pose. Here's the completed version:\n\n```csharp\nif (_updateRootPose)\n{\n    transform.localPosition = data.RootPose.Position.FromFlippedZVector3f();\n    transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Inverse(data.RootPose.Orientation.FromFlippedZQuatf()) * (Quaternion.Euler(0f, 180f, 0f) * wristFixupRotation); // Adjusting the rotation in the script because this quaternion will cause the local rotation to flip when passed to the local rotation of the skeleton (local Y direction is up in the OVRPlugin and in Unity, local Y direction is upside-down in the OVRPlugin)\n}\n```\n\nReplace the above line from your Update function in the MonoBehaviour script.\n\nHere, the root pose is updated based on the poses provided by the data provider. I've added a correction to the root rotation to account for the orientation difference between the OVRPlugin and Unity. We are flipping the local Y axis of the skeleton (which is in Unity's coordinate system but is upside-down in OVRPlugin), and rotating 180 degrees around the X axis to correct the orientation. The `wristFixupRotation` is applied to counteract any rotation issues in the provided quaternion.\n\nPlease remember to adapt this code according to your needs and requirements.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Your code seems to be incomplete and missing a significant part. I'll provide a solution to your problem based on what I can understand from your comment. However, please note that the actual solution may vary depending on your overall application.\n\nIf you're experiencing a performance issue with allocation in the `Update()` method (as you mentioned), you can avoid this by declaring a `Vector3` variable outside of the `Update()` method and reusing it for each update. This is especially efficient if you need to constantly update the local scale in your transform.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```csharp\nprivate Vector3 scaleVector;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (!ShouldUpdateBonePoses)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Rest of your code...\n\n    if (_updateRootScale)\n    {\n        scaleVector = new Vector3(data.RootScale, data.RootScale, data.RootScale);\n        transform.localScale = scaleVector;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this way, you're avoiding the allocation of a new `Vector3` for each frame. The `Vector3` is assigned a new value once for each frame, which doesn't consume much memory. \n\nPlease replace the line `transform.localScale = new Vector3(data.RootScale, data.RootScale, data.RootScale);` with this optimization.\n\nIf I misunderstood your question or if the provided solution still does not solve your problem, please provide more context or more information about your problem.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The code you provided is incorrect. It appears to be a Unity code for updating the transform of the OVRSkeleton based on the data provided by a IOVRSkeletonDataProvider. The problem is at the end where the code tries to allocate a new Vector3:\n\n```csharp\nif (_updateRootScale)\n{\n    // BUG: Using New() allocation in Update() method.\n    // MESSAGE: Update() method is called each frame. It's efficient to allocate new resource using New() in Update() method.\n    // \t\t\t\ttransform.localScale = new Vector3(data.RootScale, data.RootScale, data.RootScale);\n\n    // FIXED CODE:\n    transform.localScale = Vector3.one * data.RootScale;\n}\n```\n\nThe corrected code above replaces the `new Vector3()` with `Vector3.one * data.RootScale`. It creates a new Vector3 that scales the existing Vector3 by `data.RootScale` on all three axes.\n\nPlease replace your existing code with this corrected version and check if the problem persists."
