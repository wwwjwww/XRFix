    "code_repairing_0": "I'm sorry, but I'm not seeing your full question or the part of the code you're asking about. If you could provide more context or ask a specific question related to Unity and programming, I'll be more than happy to help you.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your question seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide the missing part of your code?",
    "code_repairing_2": "Based on your problem, it seems you're having trouble with a Unity C# code related to texturing and pixel data manipulation. However, your code is missing the part where you actually call the `UpdateViz` function in Unity's `Update()` function. This function should be called every frame to update the visualization.\n\nHere's an example of how you could do that:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    if(buffer != null) {\n        UpdateViz(buffer);\n        tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);\n        tex.Apply(false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this snippet, `buffer` should be a float array representing your audio data. The `UpdateViz` function will update the `wavepixels` array which will be used to update the texture. Remember to adjust the parameters in the `ProcessWaveTexture` DllImport according to your needs. \n\nPlease ensure that the `wavepixels` array is correctly updated in the `ProcessWaveTexture` function. If you are not modifying the `wavepixels` array correctly, the texture will not update properly. \n\nAlso, ensure that the 'SoundStageNative' library does what you expect. It's hard to determine what's going wrong if the function isn't working as expected.",
    "code_repairing_3": "You've posted a bunch of code related to creating a wave visualization using Unity and a native library in C++, but didn't ask a question. Are you looking for help with:\n\n1. Explanation of the code\n2. Debugging the code\n3. Improvements to the code\n4. Specific problem or functionality you're trying to implement\n\nPlease provide more information so I can assist you more effectively.",
    "code_repairing_4": "Your code is almost there, but it seems like you are missing the actual call to `ProcessWaveTexture` in the Update function. \n\nTry this:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n   if(bufferDrawList.Count > 0){\n       UpdateViz(bufferDrawList.ToArray());\n       bufferDrawList.Clear();\n   }\n   tex.SetPixels32(wavepixels);\n   tex.Apply(false);\n   //     waverend.material.mainTextureOffset = new Vector2((float)curWaveW / wavewidth, 0f);\n}\n\npublic void AddToBuffer(float[] buffer){\n    bufferDrawList.AddRange(buffer);\n}\n```\n\nThe `bufferDrawList` is used to collect multiple buffer calls from different parts of your program. When `Update` is called, it will process those buffered updates before continuing on with rendering. \n\nThe buffer is passed to `UpdateViz` function that calls `ProcessWaveTexture`. \n\nYou will have to modify your code depending on how you are getting the `buffer` array. You might have to move its initialization and filling onto the `AddToBuffer` function and call this from the relevant places in your code.\n\nKeep in mind that `ProcessWaveTexture` seems to be a native function, so you may need to check how to call it correctly and fill the arguments properly from your C# code.\n\nFinally, as `waverend.material.mainTextureOffset` is set to `new Vector2((float)curWaveW / wavewidth, 0f);` it seems like you're trying to scroll the texture horizontally to see the wave animation. Please add the required logic for the wave animation in its place."
