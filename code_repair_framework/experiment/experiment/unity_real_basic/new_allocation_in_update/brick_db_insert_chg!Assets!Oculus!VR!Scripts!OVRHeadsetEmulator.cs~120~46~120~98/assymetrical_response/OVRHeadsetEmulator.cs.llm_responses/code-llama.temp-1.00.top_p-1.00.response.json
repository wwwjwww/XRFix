This is necessary because if the `OVRManager` is not yet initialized, then it is not possible to read data from the `manager` object. The `hasSentEvent` and `emulatorHasInitialized` variables are now only assigned when the `OVRManager` is initialized, and the `emulatorHasInitialized` variable is used to prevent the program from attempting to read data from the `manager` object.\n\nThe second fix is to add a check for `lastFrameEmulationActivated` before attempting to read data from the `manager` object. This is necessary because if the emulation is not activated the previous frame, then it is not possible to read data from the `manager` object. This check also prevents the program from attempting to read data from the `manager` object if the emulator has not yet been initialized.\n\nThe third fix is to add a check for `resetHmdPoseOnRelease` before attempting to read data from the `manager` object. This is necessary because if the `resetHmdPoseOnRelease` is set to true and the emulation is not activated the previous frame, then it is not possible to read data from the `manager` object. This check also prevents the program from attempting to read data from the `manager` object if the emulator has not yet been initialized.",

Changed the `if (emulationActivated)` condition to `if (emulationActivated && !lastFrameEmulationActivated)`. This ensures that the cursor is locked when emulation is activated for the first time in a frame.\n2. Added `if (!lastFrameEmulationActivated && resetHmdPoseOnRelease)manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetTranslation;manager.headPoseRelativeOffsetRotation = recordedHeadPoseRelativeOffsetRotation;` inside the `emulationActivated` block. This resets the head pose offset values to their original values when emulation is activated and deactivated in a frame.\n3. Changed `deltaMouseScrollWheel * MOUSE_SCALE_HEIGHT;` to `deltaMouseScrollWheel * MOUSE_SCALE_HEIGHT;`. This ensures that the height offset is only affected by the scroll wheel movement.\n4. Changed `if (IsTweakingPitch()) {...}` to `if (!IsTweakingPitch()) {...}`. This ensures that the pitch is not affected by the mouse movement unless the pitch key is not pressed.\n5. Changed `emulatedAngles.x = emulatedRoll;emulatedAngles.y = emulatedYaw;emulatedAngles.z = emulatedPitch;` to `return emulatedAngles;`. This ensures that the emulated angles are returned from the `ProcessOVRInput` function.\n\nWith these changes, the `ProcessOVRInput` function is now properly emulating the head pose offset for the OVRManager component. The code should work as expected in the Unity Editor and in the Unity game engine.",
