    "code_repairing_0": "The code you provided appears to be incomplete. It seems you intend to make an object spin based on a type of motion specified by the `Motion` variable. However, the last part of the code (from \"// FIXED CODE:\" onward) is missing.\n\nHere's a suggestion for how you could fix the issue:\n\n```csharp\nm_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, y, z);\n```\n\nThis line is copying the original position and adding the calculated x, y, and z values to it. It should function as intended. \n\nPlease provide the rest of your code so that I can help you further.",
    "code_repairing_1": "I'm sorry, but the code you provided seems incomplete and doesn't contain relevant code for the BackAndForth motion. I can only provide a general overview of the code you posted.\n\nThis script is used to create a spinning effect on an object. It has three different motion types: Rotation, BackAndForth, and Translation.\n\n- For the Rotation type, the object rotation will change along the Y-axis based on the SpinSpeed and Time.\n- For the BackAndForth type, the object rotation will change along the Y-axis using a sine function to create a back and forth motion.\n- For the Translation type, the object position will change along 3\u8f74 (X, Y, Z).\n\nPlease provide more details if you need help with a specific part of the code or if you have a more specific question related to this code.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your code seems good on the rotation part, but you didn't provide the translation part. I'll show you the translation part as well:\n\n```csharp\n                m_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, y, z);\n            }\n        }\n\n        void OnGUI()\n        {\n            string info = \"[Object Info]\\n\";\n            info += \"Position: \" + m_transform.position + \"\\n\";\n            info += \"Rotation: \" + m_transform.rotation + \"\\n\";\n            info += \"Object Spin Speed: \" + SpinSpeed + \"\\n\\n\";\n            info += \"Rotation Range: \" + RotationRange;\n\n            GUILayout.Label(info);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will move the object on the XZ plane based on the Sin function. The Y position of the object will be constant. To control the speed and range of rotation, you can change the SpinSpeed and RotationRange variables.\n\nPlease note that I've used the Quaternion.Euler function for rotation. I don't know your specific needs, but if this function doesn't suit you, you may need to use a different method.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The issue in your code is that you are creating new vectors in the Update method each frame, which is not efficient, especially when you're updating them frequently. To get around this, you can pre-calculate and reassign the vector to a variable that's accessible across frames. Here is how you would do that:\n\n```C#\n// ...\nvoid Update()\n{\n    Vector3 newPos = m_initial_Position;\n\n    if (Motion == MotionType.Translation)\n    {\n        m_time += SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime;\n\n        float x = 15 * Mathf.Cos(m_time * .95f);\n        float y = 10 * Mathf.Sin(m_time *1f) * Mathf.Cos(m_time * 1f);\n        float z = 0f * Mathf.Sin(m_time * .9f);\n\n        newPos += new Vector3(x, y, z);\n    }\n\n    m_transform.position = newPos;\n}\n```\n\nIn the code above, `newPos` is initialized with the initial position of the transform and updates within the if statement modify the `newPos` vector according to the motion type. The only time we access `m_transform.position` is to assign `newPos` back to it. This way, even though `newPos` is not a class-level variable, it will still only be allocated once per frame, improving the efficiency of your game.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems you're looking to fix the allocation issue from your code. You can use an existing Vector3 instance to set the position if you are not creating it during the update loop. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Motion == MotionType.Rotation)\n    {\n        m_transform.Rotate(0, SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0);\n    }\n    else if (Motion == MotionType.BackAndForth)\n    {\n        m_time += SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime;\n        Vector3 newRotation = m_initial_Rotation;\n        newRotation.y = Mathf.Sin(m_time) * RotationRange + m_initial_Rotation.y;\n        m_transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(newRotation);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_time += SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime;\n        Vector3 newPosition = m_initial_Position;\n        float x = 15 * Mathf.Cos(m_time * .95f);\n        float y = 10;\n        float z = 0f;\n        newPosition += new Vector3(x, z, y);\n        m_transform.position = newPosition;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, I've created a new Vector3 instance in the BackAndForth and Translation cases to avoid the allocation in Update(). I also suggest using Debug.Log to see if this is actually working as expected."
