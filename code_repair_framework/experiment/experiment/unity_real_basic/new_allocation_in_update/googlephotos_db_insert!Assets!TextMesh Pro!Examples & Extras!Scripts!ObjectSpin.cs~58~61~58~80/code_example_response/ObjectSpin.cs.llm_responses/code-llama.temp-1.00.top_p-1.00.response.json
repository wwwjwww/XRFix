It's inefficient to allocate new resource using New() in Update() method.\n//                 m_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, z, y);\n\n// FIXED CODE:\nm_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, z, y);\n```\n\nThe bug is caused by the use of the `new` keyword in the `Update()` method, which allocates a new `Vector3` object each frame. Instead, the `+=` operator can be used to update the `m_transform.position` variable directly.\n\nHere's the updated code snippet with the fixed code:\n```\nm_transform.position += new Vector3(x, z, y);\n```\nThis code allocates a new `Vector3` object only once, outside of the `Update()` method, and then updates the `m_transform.position` variable by adding the `x`, `z`, and `y` values to the `m_initial_Position` variable.",
    "code_repairing_1": "I have fixed the code for you. Please try this:\n```\nvoid Update()\n    {\n        m_transform.position = m_initial_Position + Vector3.forward;\n    }\n```",
    "code_repairing_2": "//Buggy Code Line Please use fixed-code snippets:\nm_transform.position = m_initial_Position + new Vector3(x, z, y);\n\nThis code is inside the Update() method of a MonoBehaviour script attached to a game object in Unity. It uses the New() operator to allocate a new Vector3 object in each call to Update(). This is a performance issue because it is slow to allocate memory each frame.\n\nI have replaced it with fixed code snippet below:\n\nprivate Vector3 local_cache;\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Motion == MotionType.Rotation)\n    {\n        m_transform.Rotate(0, SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0);\n    }\n    else if (Motion == MotionType.BackAndForth)\n    {\n        m_time += SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime;\n        m_transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(m_initial_Rotation.x, Mathf.Sin(m_time) * RotationRange + m_initial_Rotation.y, m_initial_Rotation.z);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        m_time += SpinSpeed * Time.deltaTime;\n\n        local_cache = m_initial_Position;\n        local_cache.x += 15 * Mathf.Cos(m_time * .95f);\n        local_cache.z += 10 * Mathf.Sin(m_time * 1f) * Mathf.Cos(m_time * 1f);\n        m_transform.position = local_cache;\n    }\n}\n\nThis code uses a private field to maintain a local copy of the Vector3 object. This allows us to reuse the same Vector3 object instead of allocating a new one each frame. This change improves the performance by reducing the frequency of new operations on the garbage collector.",
