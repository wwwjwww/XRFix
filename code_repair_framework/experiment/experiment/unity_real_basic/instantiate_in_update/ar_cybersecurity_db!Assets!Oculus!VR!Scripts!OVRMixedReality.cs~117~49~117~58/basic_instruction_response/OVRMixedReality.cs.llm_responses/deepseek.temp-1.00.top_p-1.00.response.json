    "code_repairing_0": "It seems that the Update method in OVRMixedReality.cs is getting called on every frame, causing unnecessary instantiation operations. This can be a performance issue for large projects. \n\nHowever, without the full context of your application, it's hard to provide an exact solution. Here's a general guideline to handle this issue:\n\n1. Check your game object hierarchy and make sure there's no other component or script that's calling the `Update` method. It might be a script from an external library or part of a script combination.\n\n2. Make sure that no event or callback is triggering the `Update` method.\n\n3. In Unity, the Update method is called every frame. If it's causing performance issues, you may consider moving this code to another event or timing context.\n\nIf this doesn't solve your problem, please provide more details (like your game objects hierarchy, scripts, update context, etc.) and I can help you better. \n\nRemember to test after each major change to ensure the performance is not degrading after the changes.",
    "code_repairing_1": "To fix the issue, you should not instantiate objects within the `Update()` method in Unity. Instead, it is recommended to instantiate objects in the `Awake()` or `Start()` methods. The `Update()` method is designed to be called in every frame, and instantiating an object in this method can slow down your application and isn't efficient. \n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your code:\n\n```C#\ninternal static class OVRMixedReality\n{\n    // Define these variables as static fields before the class\n    public static bool useFakeExternalCamera = false;\n    public static Vector3 fakeCameraFloorLevelPosition = new Vector3(0.0f, 2.0f, -0.5f);\n    public static Vector3 fakeCameraEyeLevelPosition = fakeCameraFloorLevelPosition - new Vector3(0.0f, 1.8f, 0.0f);\n    public static Quaternion fakeCameraRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(\n        (new Vector3(0.0f, fakeCameraFloorLevelPosition.y, 0.0f) - fakeCameraFloorLevelPosition).normalized,\n        Vector3.up);\n    public static float fakeCameraFov = 60.0f;\n    public static float fakeCameraAspect = 16.0f / 9.0f;\n    public static OVRComposition currentComposition = null;\n\n    // Move this function to a new method called \"Update\" instead of Update()\n    // Inside this method, you can call the old Update() function\n    private void Update(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera, OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration, OVRManager.TrackingOrigin trackingOrigin)\n    {\n        // Call the old Update() function\n        // Note: Replace 'this' with the current instance of the OVRMixedReality class\n        OVRMixedReality.Update(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration, trackingOrigin);\n    }\n\n    // Include the new Update() method with appropriate parameters\n    public static void Update(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera, OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration, OVRManager.TrackingOrigin trackingOrigin)\n    {\n        // Existing logic...\n    }\n\n    // Move this method to the class from the OVRExternalComposition, as it's no longer related to this class\n    // public void RefreshCameraObjects(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera, OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration)\n    // {\n    //     // Existing logic...\n    // }\n}\n```\n\nIn this refactored code, the static fields are moved to the beginning of the class, and the update logic is moved to a new `Update()` method. The `RefreshCameraObjects()` method is left in place, although please note that it was moved due to its location in the original code. You'll need to reconsider the structure of your code to best fit the rest of your game logic.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Here is the corrected code:\n\n```csharp\npublic static void Update(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera,\n    OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration, OVRManager.TrackingOrigin trackingOrigin)\n{\n    if (!OVRPlugin.initialized)\n    {\n        Debug.LogError(\"OVRPlugin not initialized\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (!OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n    {\n        OVRPlugin.InitializeMixedReality();\n        if (OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"OVRPlugin_MixedReality initialized\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Unable to initialize OVRPlugin_MixedReality\");\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    OVRPlugin.UpdateExternalCamera();\n#if !OVR_ANDROID_MRC\n    OVRPlugin.UpdateCameraDevices();\n#endif\n\n#if OVR_ANDROID_MRC\n    useFakeExternalCamera = OVRPlugin.Media.UseMrcDebugCamera();\n#endif\n\n    if (currentComposition != null && (currentComposition.CompositionMethod() != configuration.compositionMethod))\n    {\n        currentComposition.Cleanup();\n        currentComposition = null;\n    }\n\n    if (configuration.compositionMethod == OVRManager.CompositionMethod.External && currentComposition == null)\n    {\n        currentComposition = new OVRExternalComposition(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration);\n    }\n\n    if (currentComposition != null)\n    {\n        currentComposition.Update(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration, trackingOrigin);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Debug.LogError(\"Unknown/Unsupported CompositionMethod : \" + configuration.compositionMethod);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe change that was made was in the conditional check to create the `OVRExternalComposition` instance. It was wrongly checking if `currentComposition == null` before creating the instance instead of `configuration.compositionMethod == OVRManager.CompositionMethod.External`. Now, only when CompositionMethod is External, the `OVRExternalComposition` instance will be created. \n\nMoreover, the conditional check to skip the update function call is corrected. It now calls `currentComposition.Update(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration, trackingOrigin);` only when `currentComposition` is not null.",
    "code_repairing_3": "Here's the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\n// BUG: Instantiate in Update() method\npublic static void Update(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera,\n    OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration, OVRManager.TrackingOrigin trackingOrigin)\n{\n    // Existing code...\n\n    if (configuration.compositionMethod == OVRManager.CompositionMethod.External)\n    {\n        if (currentComposition == null)\n        {\n            currentComposition = new OVRExternalComposition(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration);\n        }\n        else {\n            currentComposition.RefreshCameraObjects(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration);\n        }\n    }\n    // Existing code...\n}\n```\n\nThe `currentComposition.RefreshCameraObjects(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration);` is called when the composition method is `External`. This is done to update the external camera objects. This change should fix the issue because the objects are only instantiated once in the constructor of `OVRExternalComposition`. The `Update` method is then called within the `OVRMixedReality.Update()` method, and this update is done every frame if `useFakeExternalCamera` is `false`. \n\nPlease note that this is a basic fix. The actual solution should depend on the rest of your code. This code assumes that `RefreshCameraObjects` is the method responsible for setting up the external camera objects. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the method calls accordingly.",
    "code_repairing_4": "```C#\n// FIXED CODE:\npublic static void Update(GameObject parentObject, Camera mainCamera,\n    OVRMixedRealityCaptureConfiguration configuration, OVRManager.TrackingOrigin trackingOrigin)\n{\n    if (!OVRPlugin.initialized)\n    {\n        Debug.LogError(\"OVRPlugin not initialized\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (!OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n    {\n        OVRPlugin.InitializeMixedReality();\n        if (OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"OVRPlugin_MixedReality initialized\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.LogError(\"Unable to initialize OVRPlugin_MixedReality\");\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!OVRPlugin.IsMixedRealityInitialized())\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    if (currentComposition != null && (currentComposition.CompositionMethod() != configuration.compositionMethod))\n    {\n        currentComposition.Cleanup();\n        currentComposition = null;\n    }\n\n    if (configuration.compositionMethod == OVRManager.CompositionMethod.External)\n    {\n        if (currentComposition == null)\n        {\n            currentComposition = new OVRExternalComposition(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Debug.LogError(\"Unknown/Unsupported CompositionMethod : \" + configuration.compositionMethod);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    currentComposition.Update(parentObject, mainCamera, configuration, trackingOrigin);\n}\n```\n\nThe above code will fix the bug in the Update method. The Update method is likely called every frame, which leads to unnecessary usage of Instantiate method, which is expensive. By moving the instantiate code after the check conditions and setting up the current composition to avoid the unnecessary instantiation."
