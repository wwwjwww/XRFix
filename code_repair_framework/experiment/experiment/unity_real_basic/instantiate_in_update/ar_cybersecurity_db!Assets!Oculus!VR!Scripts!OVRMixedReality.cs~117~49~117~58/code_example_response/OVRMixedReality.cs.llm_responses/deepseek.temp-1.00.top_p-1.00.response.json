    "code_repairing_0": "The bugged code is instantiating a GameObject in the Update method which can lead to inefficiency because it instantiates an object every frame. The fix is to instantiate an object once at startup and reuse it later in the game, which is feasible using a GameObject pool. \n\nHere's the fix in your OVRMixedReality.cs file:\n\n```csharp\nif (Input.GetButtonDown(\"Fire1\"))\n{\n    GameObject gobj = GameObjectPool.GetPooledObject();\n}\nelse if(Input.GetButtonUp(\"Release\"))\n{\n    GameObjectPool.ReturnToPool(gobj);\n}\n```\n\nYou'll need to make sure your GameObjectPool script (the one you fixed at the start) is attached to the same GameObject that has the OVRMixedReality script or it can be attached elsewhere, as OVRPlugin might need access to it. It will also need to have a reference to the prefab to instantiate. If you prefer not to use a script for this, you can just replace the original GameObject instantiation with the pooled GameObject:\n\n```csharp\nGameObject gobj = OVRPlugin.Instantiate(GameObjectPool.GetPooledObject().gameObject, transform.position, transform.rotation);\n```\n\nDo note that you may need to modify other parts of the code to ensure they also utilize the pool rather than instantiating new GameObjects.",

    "code_repairing_2": "'''\nThe buggy code is using Instantiate within the Update method, which is inefficient as it results in a new object each frame. This is not only inefficient but can even lead to issues with the timing of the frames. \n\nTo fix this, you can move the instantiation of objects to the Start method or elsewhere which is called only once and not every frame. \n\nHere is the fixed code:\n\n```C#\npublic class GameObjectPool : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public GameObject prefab;\n    public int poolSize = 10;\n    private List<GameObject> pool;\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        pool = new List<GameObject>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n            obj.SetActive(false);\n            pool.Add(obj);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Rest of your code\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the pool is created during the Start method (which only gets called once at the start of the game) instead of happening every frame. This ensures that the objects are created only once and then retrieved from the pool when needed, improving performance and enhancing overall game performance.",
