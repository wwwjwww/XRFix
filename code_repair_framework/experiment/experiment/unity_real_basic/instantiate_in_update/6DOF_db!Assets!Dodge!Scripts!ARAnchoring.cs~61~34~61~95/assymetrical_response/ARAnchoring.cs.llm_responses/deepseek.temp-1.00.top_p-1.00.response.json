    "code_repairing_0": "It seems like you are trying to disable visibility of detected planes when VR mode is enabled. However, you didn't post the full code of your DetectedPlaneVisualizer class, so I can't provide an exact solution. However, you can try this approach:\n\nModify your `ARCoreBackgroundRenderer` script, so it will enable/disable the visibility of planes based on the VR mode:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARCoreBackgroundRenderer : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ...\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (ARAnchoring.isVR)\n        {\n            EnablePlaneVisibility(false); // disables plane visibility when VR mode is enabled\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            EnablePlaneVisibility(true);  // enables plane visibility when VR mode is disabled\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void EnablePlaneVisibility(bool enabled)\n    {\n        // Assuming you have a reference to your DetectedPlaneVisualizer somewhere\n        // Add below line to enable/disable visibility of detected planes in AR scene\n        DetectedPlaneVisualizer.SetActive(enabled);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the code above, you need to make sure that you have a reference to your `DetectedPlaneVisualizer` in the `ARCoreBackgroundRenderer`. This could be done through a public field in the class or found using `FindObjectOfType`.\n\nAlso, remember that `ARAnchoring.isVR` must be set someplace before this script gets called, as it's a static field and isn't updated automatically. Here you should call it somewhere in your startup code in `Start` or `Awake` methods, or from some external source.\n\nHope this helps! If not, I can provide a more specific solution if your code is related to DetectedPlaneVisualizer class.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Your question is not clear, so I'm assuming that you are asking about how to disable visibility of planes when VR (Virtual Reality) is enabled.\n\nTo disable visibility of planes when VR is enabled, you could simply hide them or deactivate them, depending on your requirement. Here is a possible solution:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARAnchoring : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public Camera FirstPersonCamera;\n    public GameObject Environment;\n    public GameObject DetectedPlanePrefab;\n    private List<DetectedPlane> m_AllPlanes = new List<DetectedPlane>();\n    public static bool isVR = false;\n\n    public void Start()\n    {\n        Screen.sleepTimeout = SleepTimeout.NeverSleep;\n        FirstPersonCamera.GetComponent<ARCoreBackgroundRenderer>().enabled = true;\n        // Initialize the detection of planes every frame\n        StartCoroutine(DetectAndInstantiatePlanes());\n    }\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if(isVR)\n        {\n            // Set planes to deactivate if VR is enabled\n            foreach (Transform t in DetectedPlanePrefab.transform)\n            {\n                t.gameObject.SetActive(false);\n           \n        }\n    }\n\n    private IEnumerator DetectAndInstantiatePlanes()\n    {\n        while (true)\n        {\n            if (Session.Status != SessionStatus.Tracking)\n            {\n                yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Get the updated plane list\n            Session.GetAllPlanes(m_AllPlanes);\n            // If we have multiple planes, find the one that is horizontal\n            for (int i = 0; i < m_AllPlanes.Count; i++)\n            {\n                if (m_AllPlanes[i].Type == DetectedPlaneType.HorizontalUp)\n                {\n                    Vector3 pos = m_AllPlanes[i].CenterPose.position;\n                    Quaternion rot = m_AllPlanes[i].CenterPose.rotation;\n                    // Update the anchor transformation\n                    DetectedPlane prefab = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, pos, rot);\n                    prefab.gameObject.SetActive(true);\n                }\n                yield return new WaitForSeconds(5f);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, planes will be deactivated (turned off) when the `isVR` variable is set to true. Note, you'd have to define what you mean by \"VR is enabled\". It likely means that ARCore became active. Please modify the `isVR` based on your application's requirement.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Your question is a bit hard to understand but I assume you are trying to check if VR (Virtual Reality) is enabled in your application. The method to check if VR is enabled is dependent on the platform you are developing for.\n\nIf you are developing for Unity for Android, the code might look something like this:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update() {\n    if(isVR){\n        //disable plane visualizer \n        var planes = FindObjectsOfType<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>();\n        foreach (var plane in planes)\n        {\n            plane.gameObject.SetActive(false);\n        }\n    } else {\n        var planes = FindObjectsOfType<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>();\n        foreach (var plane in planes)\n        {\n            plane.gameObject.SetActive(true);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, `isVR` is a variable we defined and it should be set to true if you want the planes to be displayed. Make sure to set this variable in the start function if you are using VR as your starting setting.\n\nIf you are developing for Apple's ARKit (requires iOS), you can use `XRSettings.enabled` to check if VR mode is enabled:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARAnchoring : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void Start()\n    {\n        if (XRSettings.enabled)\n        {\n            isVR = true;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            isVR = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that `XRSettings` is a property of `UnityEngine.XR` namespace. For Android devices, you don't need to handle VR activation so you can remove the XRSettings part from the code.\n\nHowever, the script above will work when ARCore or ARKit is enabled on the device as a whole. It will not differentiate between e.g. Daydream or non-Daydream views of ARCore. So, you may have to add a check for specific ARCore features or handle the ARCore settings differently based on the device.",
    "code_repairing_3": "To control the visibility of detected planes when VR mode is enabled, you have to add some scripts to your project. You need to check if VR is enabled and hide detected planes accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Update()\n{\n    foreach (var plane in m_AllPlanes)\n    {\n        if (plane.TrackableInstance.GetPlane().IsPoseInPolygon(FirstPersonCamera.transform.position))\n        {\n            var anchor = plane.TrackableInstance.GetPlane().CreateAnchor(GvrControllerMain.Instance.transform);\n            var visualizer = Instantiate(DetectedPlanePrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, transform);\n            visualizer.GetComponent<DetectedPlaneVisualizer>().Initialize(plane, anchor.transform);\n            isVR = GvrViewer.Instance.VRModeEnabled;\n            visualizer.SetActive(!isVR);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nHere's what is happening in the code above:\n\n- The `Update` method is called once per frame.\n- In this method, for each plane in `m_AllPlanes`, we check if the current camera position is within the polygon defined by the plane.\n- If the camera is inside the polygon, we create an anchor.\n- We then instantiate our visualizer (a prefab representing a detected plane), initialize it with the current plane and the anchor's transform, and finally, enable or disable it based on the `VRModeEnabled` property of `GvrViewer.Instance` (which is true when VR mode is enabled).\n\nPlease make sure you have `GvrControllerMain` and `GvrViewer` scripts in your project and they are enabled.\n\nAlso, ensure that the name of the script using `GvrControllerMain` is set to \"Main\". You can go to \"GameObject -> Main\" while Unity is in play mode to set it.\n\nMake sure to apply these changes after initializing all the components and before the `Start` method.\n\nThis code assumes you have an additional script named `DetectedPlaneVisualizer` which is responsible for rendering planes and placing them on the `transform` of its `anchor`.",
    "code_repairing_4": "You can disable the detection of planes when VR is enabled by setting `enabled` to false on `ARCoreBackgroundRenderer`. This might hide the detection of planes as well if you use `DetectedPlaneVisualizer`. \n\nYou can use `XRSettings.enabled` to check if VR is enabled. If it's true (VR is enabled), you can disable planes detection.\n\nHere is the modified code:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ARAnchoring : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public Camera FirstPersonCamera;\n    public GameObject Environment;\n    public GameObject DetectedPlanePrefab;\n    private List<DetectedPlane> m_AllPlanes = new List<DetectedPlane>();\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        Screen.sleepTimeout = SleepTimeout.NeverSleep;\n\n        // Check if VR is enabled and disable planes detection if it is.\n        if (XRSettings.enabled)\n        {\n            FirstPersonCamera.GetComponent<ARCoreBackgroundRenderer>().enabled = false;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            FirstPersonCamera.GetComponent<ARCoreBackgroundRenderer>().enabled = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, if VR is enabled (`XRSettings.enabled == true`), the script disables the camera's ability to detect planes. If VR is not enabled, then the script enables the camera to detect planes.\n\nThis should work under the assumption that you have correctly set up your Unity project for VR. You may need to add a VR-specific input scheme that allows the user to switch between AR and VR modes."
