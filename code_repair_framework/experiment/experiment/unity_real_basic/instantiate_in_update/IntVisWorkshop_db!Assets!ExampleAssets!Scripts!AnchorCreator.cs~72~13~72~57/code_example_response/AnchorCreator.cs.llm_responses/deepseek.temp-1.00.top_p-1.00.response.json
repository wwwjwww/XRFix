It's good practice to only instantiate in the moment where it's required, and not on every frame. This reduces computational overhead and makes the game run more efficiently.",
    "code_repairing_1": "Here is the fixed code segment:\n\n```\nvoid Update()\n{\n\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n\n\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n\n\n\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            var anchorObject = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform.position, anchor.transform.rotation);\n            anchorObject.transform.parent = anchor.transform;\n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThe issue was that the instantiation of the m_AnchorPrefab was done within the Update() method, which results in the instantiation happening on every frame that the Update() method is called, which is inefficient. The fixed code creates the instantiated anchor object as a child of the anchor and adds the anchor to the list only after successful creation of the anchor object.",
    "code_repairing_2": "The bug in the original code is that the instantiation of the anchor prefab in the Update() function is called every frame, which is inefficient and unnecessary. \n\nTo fix this, you should move the instantiation of the anchor prefab to a different function (e.g., CreateAnchor()) and call this function only when a new anchor is created.\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Awake()\n{\n    m_RaycastManager = GetComponent<ARRaycastManager>();\n    m_AnchorManager = GetComponent<ARAnchorManager>();\n    m_PlaneManager = GetComponent<ARPlaneManager>();\n    m_AnchorPoints = new List<ARAnchor>();\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n       \n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            CreateAnchor(anchor);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic void CreateAnchor(ARAnchor anchor)\n{\n    GameObject anchorGameObject = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform);\n    m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n}\n```\n\nIn the fixed code, the Instantiation of the anchor prefab is moved to the `CreateAnchor()` function, which will be called only when a new anchor is created via `AttachAnchor()`.",
    "code_repairing_3": "```csharp\nm_RaycastManager = GetComponent<ARRaycastManager>();\nm_AnchorManager = GetComponent<ARAnchorManager>();\nm_PlaneManager = GetComponent<ARPlaneManager>();\nm_AnchorPoints = new List<ARAnchor>();\n\nm_AnchorPrefabInstance = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab);\nm_AnchorPrefabInstance.SetActive(false);\n```\n\nIn the original code, the Instantiate method is being called inside the Update method. This is not an efficient way. It results in unnecessary memory allocation every frame and it may even cause a decrease in game performance. By instantiating the prefab outside the Update method and setting it to inactive, we can avoid these issues.\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n\n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n            UpdateAnchorPosition(anchor);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvoid UpdateAnchorPosition(ARAnchor anchor)\n{\n    var anchorTransform = anchor.transform;\n    // Reset the anchor's position\n    anchorTransform.position = Vector3.zero;\n\n    // Update the anchor's position\n    anchorTransform.position = anchor.transform.position;\n\n    // Set the instance of the prefab to active and update its position\n    m_AnchorPrefabInstance.transform.position = anchor.transform.position;\n    m_AnchorPrefabInstance.SetActive(true);\n}\n```\n\nWe added a new method UpdateAnchorPosition to update the instantiated prefab's position when an anchor is created and the prefab will be active when an AR anchor is created. This will not have memory issues and it will ensure performance is not affected.",
    "code_repairing_4": "You had a couple of issues with the update method. The first issue was with instantiating a prefab in the update method. This can lead to performance issues as instantiating an object in the update method causes the object to be created every frame which can be inefficient. Another issue was that the 'gobj' variable was not defined in the update method which could cause a compile error. Here's the correct code.\n\n```C\npublic GameObject prefab;\npublic int poolSize = 10;\nprivate List<GameObject> pool;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    pool = new List<GameObject>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n    {\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        pool.Add(obj);\n    }\n}\n\npublic GameObject gobj; // Declare the gobj variable\n\npublic GameObject GetPooledObject()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < pool.Count; i++)\n    {\n        if (!pool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n        {\n            return pool[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab);\n    obj.SetActive(false);false>>\n    pool.Add(obj);\n    Debug.LogWarning(\"Expanded object pool. Consider increasing initial pool size.\");\n    return obj;\n}\n\npublic void ReturnToPool(GameObject obj)\n{\n    obj.SetActive(false);\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Input.GetButtonDown(\"Fire1\"))\n    {\n        gobj = GetPooledObject();\n    }\n    else if(Input.GetButtonUp(\"Release\"))\n    {\n        ReturnToPool(gobj);\n    }\n}\n```\nThe original messages were not needed as the code is already optimized. It should be noted that in a real-world scenario, you would want to ensure that 'gobj' is within a certain scope where it's being used, or you should create a property to get the 'gobj' if it's needed in multiple places."
