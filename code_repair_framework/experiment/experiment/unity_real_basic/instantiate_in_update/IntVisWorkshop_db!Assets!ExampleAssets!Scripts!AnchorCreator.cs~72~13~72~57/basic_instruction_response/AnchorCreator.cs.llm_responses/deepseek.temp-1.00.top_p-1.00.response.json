    "code_repairing_0": "Calling Instantiate in Update() method is inefficient as it can cause performance issues. It's a better idea to instantiate them at the time you need them, like when an anchor is attached. You could do this in the AttachAnchor method of your ARAnchorManager. Here's how you could do it:\n\n```csharp\npublic class AnchorCreator : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    //...\n\n    public ARAnchor AttachAnchor(ARPlane plane, Pose pose)\n    {\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(plane, pose);\n\n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform.position, anchor.transform.rotation); // Instantiate anchor prefab at anchor's position and rotation\n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n        }\n\n        return anchor;\n    }\n\n    //...\n}\n```\nIn this code, whenever you attach an anchor, you not only add it to the anchor manager but also instantiate the prefab at the position and rotation of the anchor. \n\nThis way, you instantiate the prefab only when and where you need to, not every frame. This should improve your frame rate and overall performance.",
    "code_repairing_1": "You can do this by switching from `Instantiate` to `GameObject.CreatePrimitive` and `Instantiate`. This is because the Instantiate method is called once per frame, which can cause inefficiency. `CreatePrimitive` would create a primitive object immediately when called and `Instantiate` would create the object during the next frame, which is more efficient.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n        \n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            var spawnedAnchor = Instantiate(GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube), anchor.transform.position, Quaternion.identity);\n            spawnedAnchor.transform.SetParent(anchor.transform);\n            \n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, I used `GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Cube)` to create a cube object and `Instantiate` to instantiate the cube at the position of the anchor. The cube is then set as a child of the anchor using `transform.SetParent`.\n\nPlease replace `PrimitiveType.Cube` with your own game object or primitive type if needed.",
    "code_repairing_2": "void Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n\n        if (anchor != null)\n        {\n            var instantiatedObject = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform.position, anchor.transform.rotation);\n            instantiatedObject.transform.parent = anchor.transform;\n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the fixed version, the anchor is created at the right time (after checking anchor is not null) and the prefab is instantiated at the anchor's position and rotation. We also set the instantiated object as a child of the anchor to make sure it gets destroyed when the anchor is destroyed.",
    "code_repairing_3": "void Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n        CreateAnchorPrefab(anchor);\n    }\n}\n\nvoid CreateAnchorPrefab(ARAnchor anchor)\n{\n    if (m_AnchorPrefab == null)\n        return;\n\n    var go = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform.position, anchor.transform.rotation);\n    if (go == null)\n    {\n        Debug.LogError(\"Failed to instantiate Prefab\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    m_AnchorPoints.Add(anchor);\n}",
    "code_repairing_4": "The issue of using Instantiate() in the Update() method is a common performance issue. In general, you should avoid calling Instantiate inside Update() as much as possible, as it can lead to heavy processing if called every frame. Instead, you should use Instantiate() at the time of spawning the prefab. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nvoid Update()\n{\n    if (Input.touchCount == 0)\n        return;\n\n    var touch = Input.GetTouch(0);\n    if (touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n        return;\n\n    if (m_RaycastManager.Raycast(touch.position, s_Hits, TrackableType.PlaneWithinPolygon))\n    {\n        var hitPose = s_Hits[0].pose;\n        var hitTrackableId = s_Hits[0].trackableId;\n        var hitPlane = m_PlaneManager.GetPlane(hitTrackableId);\n\n        var anchor = m_AnchorManager.AttachAnchor(hitPlane, hitPose);\n\n        if (anchor == null)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Error creating anchor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            var newAnchor = Instantiate(m_AnchorPrefab, anchor.transform.position, anchor.transform.rotation);\n            m_AnchorPoints.Add(newAnchor);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the Instantiate() call is made outside the Update() method, ensuring it is only called when needed. The instantiated game object is stored in the m_AnchorPoints list, allowing you to keep track of all created anchors."
