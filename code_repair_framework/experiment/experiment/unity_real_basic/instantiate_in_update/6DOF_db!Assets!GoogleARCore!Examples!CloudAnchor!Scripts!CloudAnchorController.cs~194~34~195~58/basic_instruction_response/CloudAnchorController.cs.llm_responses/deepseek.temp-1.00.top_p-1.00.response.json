    "code_repairing_0": "The issue you're experiencing is with the use of `Instantiate()` in the `Update()` method. `Instantiate()` is called each frame, which can cause performance issues, especially if the object to be instantiated is complex or if the instantiation is being performed in a time-critical loop.\n\nTo fix this, you should move the instantiation to a more suitable location in your code, possibly in an `OnEnable()` or `Start()` method. This way, you instantiate the object just once, at the start of the application, and only when necessary (e.g., when a new anchor is placed).\n\nHere's a basic example of how to modify your code to implement this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CloudAnchorController : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private GameObject andyObject;\n\n    public void Start()\n    {\n        // ...\n        _ResetStatus();\n        // ...\n        andyObject = Instantiate(_GetAndyPrefab(), m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position,\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n        andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n        andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n    }\n\n    // ...\n\n    private void _HostLastPlacedAnchor()\n    {\n        // ... \n        // other code\n        // ...\n        // instantiate Andy again if needed\n        andyObject = Instantiate(_GetAndyPrefab(), m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position,\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n        andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n        andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the Andy object is instantiated when the CloudAnchorController is started. If the `_HostLastPlacedAnchor` function is called after the start, the object will be instantiated again at the new position. \n\nPlease adjust this code to fit your specific needs.",
    "code_repairing_1": "//                 {\n//                     var andyObject = Instantiate(_GetAndyPrefab(), m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position,\n//                         m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n// \n//                     andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n// \n//                     andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n// \n//                     _HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n//                 }\n//             }\n\nIn the code you posted, you're creating a GameObject (andyObject) with the data from _GetAndyPrefab() instantiated at the position and rotation of the last placed anchor, then setting the parent of andyObject to be the last placed anchor. Then, calling _HostLastPlacedAnchor(). \n\nInstantiating in the Update() method is generally not recommended because it causes heavy computations and memory consumption each frame. Instead, consider doing this in the FixedUpdate() method, which is called at a fixed interval rather than at every frame of the game. This can improve performance and reduce the strain on the system.",
    "code_repairing_2": "```csharp\npublic void Update ()\n{\n    _UpdateApplicationLifecycle();\n\n    if (m_CurrentMode != ApplicationMode.Hosting || m_LastPlacedAnchor != null)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    Touch touch;\n    if (Input.touchCount < 1 || (touch = Input.GetTouch(0)).phase != TouchPhase.Began)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    GameObject andyObject;\n    if ((andyObject = _GetAndyObject(touch)) != null)\n    {\n        _HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate GameObject _GetAndyObject(Touch touch)\n{\n    TrackableHit hit;\n    GameObject andyObject = null;\n\n    if (Application.platform != RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer)\n    {\n        if (Frame.Raycast(touch.position.x, touch.position.y, TrackableHitFlags.PlaneWithinPolygon, out hit))\n        {\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor = hit.Trackable.CreateAnchor(hit.Pose);\n            andyObject = Instantiate(ARCoreAndyAndroidPrefab, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Pose hitPose;\n        if (m_ARKit.RaycastPlane(ARKitFirstPersonCamera, touch.position.x, touch.position.y, out hitPose))\n        {\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor = m_ARKit.CreateAnchor(hitPose);\n            andyObject = Instantiate(ARKitAndyAndroidPrefab, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (andyObject != null)\n    {\n        andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n        andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n    }\n\n    return andyObject;\n}\n\nprivate void _HostLastPlacedAnchor()\n{\n    // Your code to host the last placed anchor here\n}\n```\nThis updated code separates the instantiation of \"andyObject\" from the rest of the `Update()` method. It also makes use of a private helper function `_GetAndyObject()` to handle the creation and instantiation of \"andyObject\". This makes your code cleaner and more maintainable.",
    "code_repairing_3": "I see that you have an issue with the instantiation of Andy Objects inside the Update() method. This is not an efficient practice as the Update method is called every frame. An more efficient way to handle this would be to use the FixedUpdate() method or on a specific event such as a button press. You can move the instantiation and rotation code to another function and call this function from your desired place. \n\nHere is a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class CloudAnchorController : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    // ... your other code\n\n    private GameObject andyObject;\n\n    // ... your Update() method\n\n    private void InstantiateAndyObject(Pose pose)\n    {\n        andyObject = Instantiate(_GetAndyPrefab(), pose.position, pose.rotation);\n        andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n        andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n    }\n\n    private void HostLastPlacedAnchor()\n    {\n        // your code to host the anchor\n    }\n}\n```\nYou could then call these methods when the object should be instantiated and when the anchor should be hosted. \n\n```csharp\nif (m_LastPlacedAnchor != null)\n{\n    if (Application.platform != RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer)\n    {\n        TrackableHit hit;\n        if (Frame.Raycast(touch.position.x, touch.position.y,\n                TrackableHitFlags.PlaneWithinPolygon, out hit))\n        {\n            InstantiateAndyObject(hit.Pose);\n            HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Pose hitPose;\n        if (m_ARKit.RaycastPlane(ARKitFirstPersonCamera, touch.position.x, touch.position.y, out hitPose))\n        {\n            InstantiateAndyObject(hitPose);\n            HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRemember to replace the `_GetAndyPrefab()` and `_HostLastPlacedAnchor()` with the appropriate functions in your real code if they exist.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like you want to use Instantiate() in your Update() method, which is inefficient because it uses resources unnecessarily. \n\nYou might want to consider moving the instantiation of the Andy object to a method that's called in a more appropriate time. For example, when the user taps on the screen.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be done:\n\n```csharp\npublic void OnTouchDown(Touch touch)\n{\n    if (Application.platform != RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer)\n    {\n        TrackableHit hit;\n        if (Frame.Raycast(touch.position.x, touch.position.y, TrackableHitFlags.PlaneWithinPolygon, out hit))\n        {\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor = hit.Trackable.CreateAnchor(hit.Pose);\n            if (m_LastPlacedAnchor != null)\n            {\n                var andyObject = Instantiate(ARCoreAndyAndroidPrefab, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n                andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n                andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n                _HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Pose hitPose;\n        if (m_ARKit.RaycastPlane(ARKitFirstPersonCamera, touch.position.x, touch.position.y, out hitPose))\n        {\n            m_LastPlacedAnchor = m_ARKit.CreateAnchor(hitPose);\n            if (m_LastPlacedAnchor != null)\n            {\n                var andyObject = Instantiate(ARKitAndyAndroidPrefab, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.position, m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform.rotation);\n                andyObject.transform.Rotate(0, k_ModelRotation, 0, Space.Self);\n                andyObject.transform.parent = m_LastPlacedAnchor.transform;\n                _HostLastPlacedAnchor();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, when the user taps the screen, the instantiation of the Andy object will be moved to the OnTouchDown() method, as this is the more appropriate time to instantiate it, as per Unity's best practices."
