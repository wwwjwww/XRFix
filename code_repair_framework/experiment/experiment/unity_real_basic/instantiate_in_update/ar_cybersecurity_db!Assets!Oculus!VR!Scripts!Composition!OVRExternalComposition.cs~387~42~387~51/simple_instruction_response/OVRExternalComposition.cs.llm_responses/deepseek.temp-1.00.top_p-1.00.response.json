    "code_repairing_0": "I'm sorry, but I can't provide you with fixed code without knowing the specific issues with the provided code. However, I can suggest common debugging & potential solutions to potential issues in code lines.\n\nDebugging:\n\n1. Review the logical flow of the code to check if the issue resides there.\n2. Confirm that all Unity objects (GameObjects & Components) are properly instantiated and referenced in your script.\n3. Ensure proper settings for the mainCamera and that it's activated in your scene.\n4. Check for missing scripts attached to the GameObjects.\n5. Check if there are any compiler warnings or errors in your code. These might reveal potential issues.\n\nPotential Solutions:\n\n1. If 'mainCamera' is null or doesn't reference a valid Camera GameObject, you might see runtime errors (NullReferenceExceptions).\n2. If the script expects different object types, you'll get runtime errors (InvalidCastExceptions).\n3. If the Camera doesn't have certain components like OVRManager, you might bypass these components and face errors.\n\nPlease note that without a specific issue description, it's hard to suggest a more accurate solution.",
    "code_repairing_1": "I'm sorry, but without the exact bug or the error message you are encountering, unable to provide a more detailed solution. However, there are a few common reasons why code can fail:\n\n1. Syntax Error: Check your syntax for errors.\n2. Type Compatibility: Make sure that you are using the correct types for variables and functions.\n3. Logic Error: The logic in your code may be causing it to fail.\n4. Runtime exceptions: Check if there are any run-time exceptions in your code.\n\nPlease provide more specific details about your issue, and I'll be able to provide a more accurate help.",
    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, your input seems incomplete. Please provide the specific issues or bugs you encountered in the code, so I can assist you more effectively.",
    "code_repairing_3": "It seems like you're looking for a solution to the code you provided here. However, without knowing specifically what issues this code is meant to fix, it's challenging to provide a suitable solution. \n\nPlease provide details about the bugs you are encountering or the functionality you wish to improve in the code so that I may assist you better.",
    "code_repairing_4": "It seems like the code you posted is a section from the `OVRExternalComposition` class, which is part of the Oculus SDK used in Unity for VR applications. However, without being explicitly provided the bug or inconsistency in the code, it's hard to provide a fixed code.\n\nIt would be helpful if you provided a clear description of what the issue or bug is. I'll be able to help you better, provided with the details that may have caused the issue."
