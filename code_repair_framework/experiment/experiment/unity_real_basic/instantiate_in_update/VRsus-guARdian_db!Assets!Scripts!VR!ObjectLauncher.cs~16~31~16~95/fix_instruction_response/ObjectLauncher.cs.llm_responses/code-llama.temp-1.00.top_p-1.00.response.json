To fix this, we can move the `Instantiate` function to the `Start` method, which is only called once when the game starts. We also need to create a private variable to store the temporary object, and assign its `Rigidbody` component.\n\nThe `Instantiate` function is used to create a new instance of the object, and we assign the `Launchable` component to it, which sets the `button` field to the value of the `button` field in the `ObjectLauncher` component. We also assign the `Player` field to the value of the `player` field in the `ObjectLauncher` component.\n\nWe call the `Instantiate` function in the `Update` method only if the `Input.GetButtonDown(button)` is true, which means that the user has pressed the `button` button. We then use the `Instantiate` function to create a new instance of the object and assign its `Rigidbody` component to it. We also assign its `Player` field to the value of the `player` field in the `ObjectLauncher` component.\n\nThe rest of the code is unchanged. The `ObjectLauncher` component can now be instantiated with the `ObjectLauncher.Instantiate()` method, and the `GameObject` can be launched with the `Launchable.button` field.",
