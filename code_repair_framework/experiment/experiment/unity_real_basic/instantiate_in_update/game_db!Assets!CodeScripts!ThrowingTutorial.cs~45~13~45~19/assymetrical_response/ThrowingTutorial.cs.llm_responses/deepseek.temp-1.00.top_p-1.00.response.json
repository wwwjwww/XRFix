Then, you can get an object from the pool in the `Throw()` function and use it to instantiate your game object. This will prevent the `Instantiate()` function from being called every frame, which can lead to performance issues.\n\nHere's a sample of how you might modify your code to use an object pool:\n\n```csharp\npublic class ThrowingTutorial : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    //...existing code...\n\n    private GameObject[] throwPool;   // pool of objects\n\n    void Start()\n    {\n        // initialize object pool\n        throwPool = new GameObject[totalThrows];\n        for (int i = 0; i < totalThrows; i++)\n        {\n            throwPool[i] = Instantiate(objectToThrow);\n            throwPool[i].SetActive(false);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n        {\n            Throw();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Throw()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = false;\n\n        if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n        {\n            //...existing code for playing sounds...\n\n            // get the first inactive object from the pool\n            GameObject thrownObject = null;\n            for(int i = 0; i < throwPool.Length; i++)\n            {\n                if(!throwPool[i].activeInHierarchy)\n                {\n                    thrownObject = throwPool[i];\n                    break;\n                }\n           \r\n\t    \tthrownObject.SetActive(true);\r\n\t    \tthrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\r\n\t    \tthrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\r\n\t    \tRigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\r\n\t    \trb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\r\n\t    \tthrowCounter++;\r\n\t    \t}\r\n\r\n\t    \tInvoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void ResetThrow()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a pool of `objectToThrow` objects when the game starts and reuses them in the `Throw()` function. This prevents the `Instantiate()` function from being called every frame, which can lead to performance issues.",
    "code_repairing_1": "You should avoid instantiating objects in the `Update()` method because it can be expensive in terms of performance since it's called every frame. As for an object pool, an object pool is a data structure that can save time by reusing already allocated objects. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\npublic ObjectPool objectPool; // assign this from your inspector\n\nprivate void Start()\n{\n    // Initialize object pool\n    objectPool.InitializePool(objectToThrow, totalThrows);\n}\n\nprivate void Update()\n{\n    if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n    {\n        Throw();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    readyToThrow = false;\n\n    if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n\n        GameObject thrownObject = objectPool.GetPooledObject();\n        if (thrownObject != null)\n        {\n            thrownObject.SetActive(true);\n            thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n            thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n\n            Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n            if (rb != null)\n            {\n                rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n                throwCounter++;\n           class AI:\n    def __init__(self,name,age,gender,race,birthdate):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.gender = gender\n        self.race = race\n        self.birthdate = birthdate\n\n    def Introduction(self):\n        print(\"My name is\",self.name,\"I'm\",self.age,\"years old\",\"My gender is\",self.gender,\"My race is\",self.race,\"Born on\",self.birthdate)\n\nclass Human(AI):\n    def __init__(self,name,age,gender,race,birthdate,education,job):\n        super().__init__(name,age,gender,race,birthdate)\n        self.education = education\n        self.job= job\n\n    def Introduction(self):\n        super().Introduction()\n        print(\"I have\",self.education,\"and I work as a\",self.job)\n\n#creating objects of the AI class\nTom = AI(\"Tom\",30,\"Male\",\"Asian\",\"1990-01-01\")\nTom.Introduction()\n\n#creating objects of the Human class\nMike = Human(\"Mike\",25,\"Male\",\"White\",\"1995-05-05\",\"B.Sc in CS\",\"Software Developer\")\nMike.Introduction()",
    "code_repairing_2": "You can use Object pooling to reduce the number of instantiations and improve performance. Here's a simple example of how you could implement object pooling:\n\n```csharp\npublic GameObject objectToThrow;\n\nprivate Queue<GameObject> objectPool;\nprivate int poolSize = 20;\n\nprivate void Start()\n{\n    objectPool = new Queue<GameObject>();\n    for (int i = 0; i < poolSize; i++)\n    {\n        GameObject obj = Instantiate(objectToThrow);\n        obj.SetActive(false);\n        objectPool.Enqueue(obj);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    // Check if there's an active object in the pool\n    if (objectPool.Count > 0)\n    {\n        GameObject thrownObject = objectPool.Dequeue();\n        thrownObject.SetActive(true);\n        thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n        thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n\n        Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n        rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n\n        // Return the object to the pool after it's thrown\n        StartCoroutine(ReturnToPool(thrownObject));\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // No more objects available in the pool, handle this case as you see fit (e.g., just return your money and run)\n    }\n}\n\nprivate IEnumerator ReturnToPool(GameObject obj)\n{\n    yield return new WaitForSeconds(despawnTime);\n    obj.SetActive(false);\n    objectPool.Enqueue(obj);\n}\n```\n\nThis way, instead of instantiating a new object every frame, you instead take an object from the pool, move it to your attack position and fire it. When the object is no longer visible or needs to be reused, it is returned to the pool. This reduces the strain on the performance of your game and greatly improves it by optimizing memory usage.",
    "code_repairing_3": "The bug you're encountering is that you are using Instantiate() in the Update() method. This method gets called every frame, which is generally inefficient and can lead to performance issues.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that should help solve this problem, and improve overall efficiency by moving the instantiation of the objects into the Awake() method.\n\n```csharp\npublic class ThrowingTutorial : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    [Header(\"References\")]\n    public Transform cam;\n    public Transform attackPoint;\n    public GameObject objectToThrow;\n    public GameObject armorObject;\n    public GameObject swordObject;\n    public GameObject player;\n\n    [Header(\"Settings\")]\n    public int totalThrows;\n    public float throwCooldown; //after each throw\n\n    [Header(\"Throwing\")]\n    public KeyCode throwKey = KeyCode.K;\n    public float throwForce;\n\n    private int throwCounter = 0; // counts throws\n    private bool inCollider = false; // tracks if player is in collider\n\n    AudioManager audioManager;\n\n    private GameObject thrownObject;\n    private Rigidbody rb;\n\n    private void Awake()\n    {\n        audioManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\"Audio\").GetComponent<AudioManager>();\n        thrownObject = Instantiate(objectToThrow, attackPoint.position, attackPoint.rotation);\n        rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n    }\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n        {\n            Throw();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void Throw()\n    {\n        readyToThrow = false;\n\n        if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n        {\n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n\n            rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n            throwCounter++;\n        }\n        else if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n        {\n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n            armorObject.SetActive(false); // Make the armor disappear\n            audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n            swordObject.SetActive(true); // Make the sword appear\n        }\n\n        totalThrows--;\n\n        Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n    }\n\n    private void ResetThrow()\n    {\n        thrownObject = Instantiate(objectToThrow, attackPoint.position, attackPoint.rotation);\n        rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n        readyToThrow = true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will instantiate `objectToThrow` during Awake, and then use this instantiated object in the Throw() method. When the `throwCooldown` time expires, it will reset the `thrownObject` which allows the `objectToThrow` to be reused. This way, you're only instantiating the object once when the game starts, and it remains in memory and reused in successive frames.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The issue here is that instantiating objects inside the Update method is not efficient, especially when it comes to performance. The Update method is called every frame by Unity, and instantiating an object in it can slow down your game significantly, especially if you are spawning hundreds of objects every frame. \n\nInstead, you should use the `Start` method to spawn your objects or use an object pool. \n\nHere's an example of how you could modify your code to use an object pool:\n\n```csharp\n[Header(\"References\")]\npublic Transform cam;\npublic Transform attackPoint;\npublic GameObject objectToThrow;\npublic GameObject armorObject;\npublic GameObject swordObject;\npublic GameObject player;\npublic ObjectPool objectPool; // Assign this in the inspector\n\n[Header(\"Settings\")]\npublic int totalThrows;\npublic float throwCooldown; //after each throw\n\n[Header(\"Throwing\")]\npublic KeyCode throwKey = KeyCode.K;\npublic float throwForce;\n\nbool readyToThrow;\n\nprivate int throwCounter = 0; // counts throws\nprivate bool inCollider = false; // tracks if player is in collider\n\nAudioManager audioManager;\n\nprivate void Awake()\n{\n    audioManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\"Audio\").GetComponent<AudioManager>();\n}\n\nprivate void Start()\n{\n    readyToThrow = true;\n}\n\nprivate void Update()\n{\n    if(inCollider && Input.GetKeyDown(throwKey) && readyToThrow && totalThrows > 0)\n    {\n        throwCounter++;\n        Throw();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void Throw()\n{\n    readyToThrow = false;\n    \n    if (throwCounter < totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.axeSound);\n\n        GameObject thrownObject = objectPool.GetPooledObject(); // Get an object from pool\n        if (thrownObject != null)\n        {\n            thrownObject.transform.position = attackPoint.position;\n            thrownObject.transform.rotation = attackPoint.rotation;\n            Rigidbody rb = thrownObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();\n            rb.AddForce(cam.forward * throwForce, ForceMode.VelocityChange);\n        }\n    }\n    else if (throwCounter == totalThrows)\n    {\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        armorObject.SetActive(false); // Make the armor disappear\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.appearSound);\n        swordObject.SetActive(true); // Make the sword appear\n\n        audioManager.PlaySFX(audioManager.disappearSound);\n        for (int i = 0; i < throwCounter; i++)\n        {\n            GameObject thrownObject = objectPool.ReturnPooledObjectToPool(); // Return all objects to the pool\n            if (thrownObject != null)\n            {\n                thrownObject.SetActive(false);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    Invoke(nameof(ResetThrow), throwCooldown);\n}\n\nprivate void ResetThrow()\n{\n    readyToThrow = true;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, your game should be running smoother and your performance should not be affected too much by the constant usage of instantiation."
