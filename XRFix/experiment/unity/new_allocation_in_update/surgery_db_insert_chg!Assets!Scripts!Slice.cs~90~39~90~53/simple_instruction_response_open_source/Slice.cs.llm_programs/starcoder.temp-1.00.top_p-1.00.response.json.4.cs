The Titanic sank in 1912, there were over 2,200 people on board and sadly more than 1,500 people lost their lives. We begin our story on the deck of the ship, the RMS Titanic, on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England to New York City. The ship's captain, Edward John Smith, gave the signal to start the engines, and the ship quickly gained speed.

Meanwhile, in a small boat outside the Titanic, a young woman named Rose was waiting for her fiancé, Jack, to join her. Rose was from the small town of Cleveland, Ohio, and she had travelled all the way to meet Jack in New York. She was travelling first class, which meant she had her own cabin on the ship.

                // We want to delete 3 vertices, which is the second parameter here
                triangles.RemoveRange(startIndex, 3);
