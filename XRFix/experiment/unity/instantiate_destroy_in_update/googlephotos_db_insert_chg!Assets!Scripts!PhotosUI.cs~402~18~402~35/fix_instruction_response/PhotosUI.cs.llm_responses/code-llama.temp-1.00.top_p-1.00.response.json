The `NextPhoto` and `PreviousPhoto` methods were not properly handling the case where the user navigated past the end of the sprite list.\n2. The code was not properly initializing the `currentImage` sprite with the first sprite in the list.\n3. The code was not properly updating the `currentImage` sprite when a new image was selected.\n\nI fixed these issues by using the `sprites` list properly in `NextPhoto` and `PreviousPhoto`, and by updating the `currentImage` sprite when a new image is selected. I also fixed the initial image setting.",
