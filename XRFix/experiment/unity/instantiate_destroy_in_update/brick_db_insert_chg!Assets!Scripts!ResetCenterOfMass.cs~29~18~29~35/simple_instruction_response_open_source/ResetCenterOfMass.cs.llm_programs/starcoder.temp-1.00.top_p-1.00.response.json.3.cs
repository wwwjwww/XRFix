/* BUG: Instantiate/Destroy in Update() method
* MESSAGE: Update() method is called each frame. It's inefficient to use Instantiate(ï¼‰ and Destroy() in Update() method.
*     void Update()
*     {
*         timer+=Time.deltaTime;
* 
*         if (!instantiate_gobj && timer >= timeLimit)

*             instantiate_gobj = false;
*         }
*         

* you can try to build an object pool before Update() method has been called.
