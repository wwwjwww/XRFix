In the provided code, there are several errors preventing it from compiling. These errors are:

1. The GameObject gobj2 and the GameObject a2 do not exist, so the code throws an error when it tries to access them. These variables should be declared and instantiated before they are accessed.

2. The Update function does not have any parameters, so the code "OVRInput.Get(OVRInput.Button.Two) && Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftShift)" will throw an error because OVRInput.Get does not exist. The OVRInput class should be added to the using
    }
