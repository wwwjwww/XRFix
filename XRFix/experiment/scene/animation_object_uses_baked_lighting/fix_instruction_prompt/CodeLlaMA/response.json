    "code_repairing_2": "Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the fixed YAML code:\n\n'''\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n'''\n\nThe changes I made are as follows:\n\n1. Changed the value of `m_Lightmapping` from 2 (baked lighting) to 1 (real-time lighting).",
    "code_repairing_3": "Sure, I can help you with that.\n\nTo fix the bug, you need to change the value of the \"m_Lightmapping\" field to \"1\" (real-time lighting) instead of \"2\" (baked lighting). This can be achieved by replacing the entire \"Light\" section of the code with the following:\n```yaml\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 1\n```\nSo the final YAML code snippet should look like this:\n```yaml\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 1\n```\nWith this modification, the animation object should now be using real-time lighting instead of baked lighting, which should fix the suboptimal performance issue.",
    "code_repairing_4": "The bug in the YAML file is caused by the \"m_Lightmapping\" setting being set to \"2\", which is for baked lighting. To fix the bug, we need to change the setting to \"1\", which is for real-time lighting.\n\nHere's the fixed version of the YAML file:\n```\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1\n```\nNote: The \"Light\" section is where the bug is located. The \"m_Lightmapping\" setting is where we need to make the change."
