This will disable baked lighting for the animation objects and instead use real-time lighting.\n\nHere's the fixed YAML file:\n```\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 0\n```",
    "code_repairing_1": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the corrected YAML file:\n\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\nm_Lightmapping: 1",
    "code_repairing_2": "The YAML code is written in a nested format, with the \"Animator\" and \"Light\" components as separate blocks. The \"Animator\" block has a reference to the \"Light\" block using the \"Light\" property.\n\nThe \"m_Lightmapping\" property is defined in the \"Light\" block as a scalar value, and it is set to 2.\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to set the \"m_Lightmapping\" property to a more appropriate value. In this case, we can set it to 0, which means that the object does not use baked lighting.\n\nHere's the fixed code:\n```\nAnimator:\n...\nLight:\n    m_Lightmapping: 0\n```",

    "code_repairing_4": "To fix the issue of using baked lighting for animation objects, you can modify the \"Light\" tag in the YAML file as follows:\n```\nLight:\n  m_Lightmapping: 1\n```\nThis sets the \"m_Lightmapping\" value to 1, which indicates that the light should be represented using dynamic lighting rather than baked lighting."
